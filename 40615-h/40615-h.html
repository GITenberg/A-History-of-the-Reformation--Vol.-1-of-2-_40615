        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This History of
        the Reformation has been written with the intention of describing a
        great religious movement amid its social environment. The times were
        heroic, and produced great men, with striking individualities not
        easily weighed in modern balances. The age is sufficiently remote to
        compel us to remember that while the morality of one century can be
        judged by another, the men who belong to it must be judged by the
        standard of their contemporaries, and not altogether by ours. The
        religious revival was set in a framework of political, intellectual,
        and economic changes, and cannot be disentangled from its
        surroundings without danger of mutilation. All these things add to
        the difficulty of description.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My excuse, if
        excuse be needed, for venturing on the task is that the period is one
        to which I have devoted special attention for many years, and that I
        have read and re-read most of the original contemporary sources of
        information. While full use has been made of the labours of
        predecessors in the same field, no chapter in the volume, save that
        on the political condition of Europe, has been written without
        constant reference to contemporary evidence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A History of the
        Reformation, it appears to me, must describe five distinct but
        related things—the social and religious conditions of the age out of
        which the great <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg
        viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        movement came; the Lutheran Reformation down to 1555, when it
        received legal recognition; the Reformation in countries beyond
        Germany which did not submit to the guidance of Luther; the issue of
        certain portions of the religious life of the Middle Ages in
        Anabaptism, Socinianism, and Anti-Trinitarianism; and, finally, the
        Counter-Reformation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second follows
        the first in natural succession; but the third was almost
        contemporary with the second. If the Reformation won its way to legal
        recognition earlier in Germany than in any other land, its beginnings
        in France, England, and perhaps the Netherlands, had appeared before
        Luther had published his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span>. I have not found it
        possible to describe all the five in chronological order.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This volume
        describes the eve of the Reformation and the movement itself under
        the guidance of Luther. In a second volume I hope to deal with the
        Reformation beyond Germany, with Anabaptism, Socinianism, and kindred
        matters which had their roots far back in the Middle Ages, and with
        the Counter-Reformation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first part of
        this volume deals with the intellectual, social, and religious life
        of the age which gave birth to the Reformation. The intellectual life
        of the times has been frequently described, and its economic
        conditions are beginning to attract attention. But few have cared to
        investigate popular and family religious life in the decades before
        the great revival. Yet for the history of the Reformation movement
        nothing can be more important. When it is studied, it can be seen
        that the evangelical revival was not a unique phenomenon, entirely
        unconnected with the immediate past. There was a continuity in the
        religious life of the period. The same hymns were sung in public and
        in private after the Reformation which had been in <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id="Pgix"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> use before Luther raised the standard of
        revolt. Many of the prayers in the Reformation liturgies came from
        the service-books of the mediæval Church. Much of the family
        instruction in religious matters received by the Reformers when they
        were children was in turn taught by them to the succeeding
        generation. The great Reformation had its roots in the simple
        evangelical piety which had never entirely disappeared in the
        mediæval Church. Luther's teaching was recognised by thousands to be
        no startling novelty, but something which they had always at heart
        believed, though they might not have been able to formulate it. It is
        true that Luther and his fellow-Reformers taught their generation
        that Our Lord, Jesus Christ, filled the whole sphere of God, and that
        other mediators and intercessors were superfluous, and that they also
        delivered it from the fear of a priestly caste; but men did not
        receive that teaching as entirely new; they rather accepted it as
        something they had always felt, though they had not been able to give
        their feelings due and complete expression. It is true that this
        simple piety had been set in a framework of superstition, and that
        the Church had been generally looked upon as an institution within
        which priests exercised a secret science of redemption through their
        power over the sacraments; but the old evangelical piety existed, and
        its traces can be found when sought for.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A portion of the
        chapter which describes the family and popular religious life
        immediately preceding the Reformation has already appeared in the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London
        Quarterly Review</span></span> for October 1903.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In describing the
        beginnings of the Lutheran Reformation, I have had to go over the
        same ground covered by my chapter on <span class=

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cambridge

        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a name="Pgx" id=
        "Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not to repeat myself. This is
        specially the case with the account given of the theory and practice
        of Indulgences. It ought to be said, however, that in view of certain
        strictures on the earlier work by Roman Catholic reviewers, I have
        gone over again the statements made about Indulgences by the great
        mediæval theologians of the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, and
        have not been able to change the opinions previously expressed.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Strong and
            masterful Popes had for centuries insisted on exercising powers
            which, they asserted, belonged to them as the successors of St.
            Peter and the representatives of Christ upon earth.
            Ecclesiastical jurists had translated their assertions into legal
            language, and had expressed them in principles borrowed from the
            old imperial law. Precedents, needed by the legal mind to unite
            the past with the present, had been found in a series of
            imaginary papal judgments extending over past centuries. The
            forged decretals of the pseudo-Isidor (used by Pope Nicholas
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">i.</span></span> in his letter of 866
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> to the bishops of
            Gaul), of the group of canonists who supported the pretensions of
            Pope Gregory <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vii.</span></span> (1073-1085),—Anselm
            of Lucca, Deusdedit, Cardinal Bonzio, and Gregory of Pavia,—gave
            to the papal claims the semblance of the sanction of antiquity.
            The Decretum of Gratian, issued in 1150 from Bologna, then the
            most famous Law School in Europe, incorporated all these earlier
            forgeries and added new ones. It displaced the older collections
            of Canon Law and became the starting-point for succeeding
            canonists. Its mosaic of facts and falsehoods formed the basis
            for the theories of the imperial powers and of the universal
            jurisdiction of the Bishops of Rome.<a id="noteref_3" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            picturesque religious background of this conception of the Church
            of Christ as a great temporal empire had been furnished by St.
            Augustine, although probably he would have been the first to
            protest against the use made of his vision of the City of God.
            His unfinished masterpiece, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">De Civitate Dei</span></span>, in which with
            a devout and glowing imagination he had contrasted the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Civitas
            Terrena</span></span>, or the secular State founded on conquest
            and maintained by fraud and violence, with the Kingdom of God,
            which he identified with the visible ecclesiastical society, had
            filled the imagination of all Christians in the days immediately
            preceding the dissolution of the Roman Empire of the West, and
            had contributed in a remarkable degree to the <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id=
            "Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> final overthrow of the last
            remains of a cultured paganism. It became the sketch outline
            which the jurists of the Roman Curia gradually filled in with
            details by their strictly defined and legally expressed claim of
            the Roman Pontiff to a universal jurisdiction. Its living but
            poetically indefinite ideas were transformed into clearly defined
            legal principles found ready-made in the all-embracing
            jurisprudence of the ancient empire, and were analysed and
            exhibited in definite claims to rule and to judge in every
            department of human activity. When poetic thoughts, which from
            their very nature stretch forward towards and melt in the
            infinite, are imprisoned within legal formulas and are changed
            into principles of practical jurisprudence, they lose all their
            distinctive character, and the creation which embodies them
            becomes very different from what it was meant to be. The
            mischievous activity of the Roman canonists actually transformed
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Civitas Dei</span></span> of the glorious
            vision of St. Augustine into that <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Civitas
            Terrena</span></span> which he reprobated, and the ideal Kingdom
            of God became a vulgar earthly monarchy, with all the
            accompaniments of conquest, fraud, and violence which, according
            to the great theologian of the West, naturally belonged to such a
            society. But the glamour of the City of God long remained to
            dazzle the eyes of gifted and pious men during the earlier Middle
            Ages, when they contemplated the visible ecclesiastical empire
            ruled by the Bishop of Rome.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            requirements of the practical religion of everyday life were also
            believed to be in the possession of this ecclesiastical monarchy
            to give and to withhold. For it was the almost universal belief
            of mediæval piety that the mediation of a priest was essential to
            salvation; and the priesthood was an integral part of this
            monarchy, and did not exist outside its boundaries. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“No good Catholic Christian doubted that in spiritual
            things the clergy were the divinely appointed superiors of the
            laity, that this power proceeded from the right of the priests to
            celebrate the sacraments, that the Pope was the real possessor of
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name=
            "Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> this power, and

            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            the decades immediately preceding the Reformation, many an
            educated man might have doubts about this power of the clergy
            over the spiritual and eternal welfare of men and women; but when
            it came to the point, almost no one could venture to say that
            there was nothing in it. And so long as the feeling remained that
            there might be something in it, the anxieties, to say the least,
            which Christian men and women could not help having when they
            looked forward to an unknown future, made kings and peoples
            hesitate before they offered defiance to the Pope and the clergy.
            The spiritual powers which were believed to come from the
            exclusive possession of priesthood and sacraments went for much
            in increasing the authority of the papal empire and in binding it
            together in one compact whole.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the earlier
            Middle Ages the claims of the Papacy to universal supremacy had
            been urged and defended by ecclesiastical jurists alone; but in
            the thirteenth century theology also began to state them from its
            own point of view. Thomas Aquinas set himself to prove that
            submission to the Roman Pontiff was necessary for every human
            being. He declared that, under the law of the New Testament, the
            king must be subject to the priest to the extent that, if kings
            proved to be heretics or schismatics, the Bishop of Rome was
            entitled to deprive them of all kingly authority by releasing
            subjects from their ordinary obedience.<a id="noteref_5" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The former,
            stated in its widest extent, was the right to depose kings, free
            their subjects from their allegiance, and bestow their
            territories on another. It could only be <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> enforced when the Pope found a stronger
            potentate willing to carry out his orders, and was naturally but
            rarely exercised. Two instances, however, occurred not long
            before the Reformation. George Podiebrod, the King of Bohemia,
            offended the Bishop of Rome by insisting that the Roman See
            should keep the bargain made with his Hussite subjects at the
            Council of Basel. He was summoned to Rome to be tried as a
            heretic by Pope Pius <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span> in 1464, and by Pope
            Paul <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span> in 1465, and was
            declared by the latter to be deposed; his subjects were released
            from their allegiance, and his kingdom was offered to Matthias
            Corvinus, the King of Hungary, who gladly accepted the offer, and
            a protracted and bloody war was the consequence. Later still, in
            1511, Pope Julius <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span> excommunicated the
            King of Navarre, and empowered any neighbouring king to seize his
            dominions—an offer readily accepted by Ferdinand of Aragon.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was
            generally, however, in more indirect ways that this claim to
            temporal supremacy, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> to direct the policy, and
            to be the final arbiter in the actions of temporal sovereigns,
            made itself felt. A great potentate, placed over the loosely
            formed kingdoms of the Middle Ages, hesitated to provoke a
            contest with an authority which was able to give religious
            sanction to the rebellion of powerful feudal nobles seeking a
            legitimate pretext for defying him, or which could deprive his
            subjects of the external consolations of religion by laying the
            whole or part of his dominions under an interdict. We are not to
            suppose that the exercise of this claim of temporal supremacy was
            always an evil thing. Time after time the actions and
            interference of right-minded Popes proved that the temporal
            supremacy of the Bishop of Rome meant that moral considerations
            must have due weight attached to them in the international
            affairs of Europe; and this fact, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> recognised and felt, accounted largely for
            much of the practical acquiescence in the papal claims. But from
            the time when the Papacy became, on its temporal side, an Italian
            power, and when its international policy had for its chief motive
            to increase the political prestige of the Bishop of Rome within
            the Italian peninsula, the moral standard of the papal court was
            hopelessly lowered, and it no longer had even the semblance of
            representing morality in the international affairs of Europe. The
            change may be roughly dated from the pontificate of Pope Sixtus
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">iv.</span></span> (1471-1484), or from
            the birth of Luther (November 10th, 1483). The possession of the
            Papacy gave this advantage to Sixtus over his contemporaries in
            Italy, that he <span class="tei tei-q">“was relieved of all
            ordinary considerations of decency, consistency, or prudence,
            because his position as Pope saved him from serious
            disaster.”</span> The divine authority, assumed by the Popes as
            the representatives of Christ upon earth, meant for Sixtus and
            his immediate successors that they were above the requirements of
            common morality, and had the right for themselves or for their
            allies to break the most solemn treaties when it suited their
            shifting policy.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 120%">§ 3. The Spiritual
            Supremacy.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            ecclesiastical supremacy was gradually interpreted to mean that
            the Bishop of Rome was the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">one</span></em> or universal bishop in whom
            all spiritual and ecclesiastical powers were summed up, and that
            all other members of the hierarchy were simply delegates selected
            by him for the purposes of administration. On this
            interpretation, the Bishop of Rome was the absolute monarch over
            a kingdom which was called spiritual, but which was as thoroughly
            material as were those of France, Spain, or England. For,
            according to mediæval ideas, men were spiritual if they had taken
            orders, or were under monastic vows; fields, drains, and fences
            were spiritual things if they were Church property; a house, a
            barn, or a byre was a spiritual thing, if it stood on land
            belonging to the Church. This papal <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> kingdom, miscalled spiritual, lay scattered
            over Europe in diocesan lands, convent estates, and parish
            glebes—interwoven in the web of the ordinary kingdoms and
            principalities of Europe. It was part of the Pope's claim to
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">spiritual</span></em> supremacy that his
            subjects (the clergy) owed no allegiance to the monarch within
            whose territories they resided; that they lived outside the
            sphere of civil legislation and taxation; and that they were
            under special laws imposed on them by their supreme spiritual
            ruler, and paid taxes to him and to him alone. The claim to
            spiritual supremacy therefore involved endless interference with
            the rights of temporal sovereignty in every country in Europe,
            and things civil and things sacred were so inextricably mixed
            that it is quite impossible to speak of the Reformation as a
            purely religious movement. It was also an endeavour to put an end
            to the exemption of the Church and its possessions from all
            secular control, and to her constant encroachment on secular
            territory.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To show how
            this claim for spiritual supremacy trespassed continually on the
            domain of secular authority and created a spirit of unrest all
            over Europe, we have only to look at its exercise in the matter
            of patronage to benefices, to the way in which the common law of
            the Church interfered with the special civil laws of European
            States, and to the increasing burden of papal requisitions of
            money.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the case of
            bishops, the theory was that the dean and chapter elected, and
            that the bishop-elect had to be confirmed by the Pope. This
            procedure provided for the selection locally of a suitable
            spiritual ruler, and also for the supremacy of the head of the
            Church. The mediæval bishops, however, were temporal lords of
            great influence in the civil affairs of the kingdom or
            principality within which their dioceses were placed, and it was
            naturally an object of interest to kings and princes to secure
            men who would be faithful to themselves. Hence the tendency was
            for the civil authorities to interfere more or less in episcopal
            appointments. This frequently resulted in making these elections
            a matter of conflict between the head of <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> the Church in Rome and the head of the
            State in France, England, or Germany; in which case the rights of
            the dean and chapter were commonly of small account. The contest
            was in the nature of things almost inevitable even when the civil
            and the ecclesiastical powers were actuated by the best motives,
            and when both sought to appoint men competent to discharge the
            duties of the position with ability. But the best motives were
            not always active. Diocesan rents were large, and the incomes of
            bishops made excellent provision for the favourite followers of
            kings and of Popes, and if the revenues of one see failed to
            express royal or papal favour adequately, the favourite could be
            appointed to several sees at once. Papal nepotism became a
            byword; but it ought to be remembered that kingly nepotism also
            existed. Pope Sixtus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">v.</span></span> insisted on
            appointing a retainer of his nephew, Cardinal Giuliano della
            Rovere, to the see of Modrus in Hungary, and after a contest of
            three years carried his point in 1483; and Matthias Corvinus,
            King of Hungary, gave the archbishopric of Gran to Ippolito
            d'Este, a youth under age, and after a two years' struggle
            compelled the Pope to confirm the appointment in 1487.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the
            fourteenth century the Papacy endeavoured to obtain a more
            complete control over ecclesiastical appointments by means of the
            system of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reservations</span></span> which figures so
            largely in local ecclesiastical affairs to the discredit of the
            Papacy during the years before the Reformation. For at least a
            century earlier, Popes had been accustomed to declare on various
            pretexts that certain benefices were <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">vacantes apud Sedem
            Apostolicam</span></span>, which meant that the Bishop of Rome
            reserved the appointment for himself. Pope John <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">xxii.</span></span> (1316-1334),
            founding on such previous practice, laid down a series of rules
            stating what benefices were to be reserved for the papal
            patronage. The ostensible reason for this legislation was to
            prevent the growing evil of pluralities; but, as in all cases of
            papal lawmaking, these <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Constitutiones Johanninæ</span></span> had
            the effect of binding ecclesiastically all patrons but the Popes
            themselves. For <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg
            010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the Popes always maintained that they alone were superior to the
            laws which they made. They were <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">supra legem</span></span> or <span lang="la"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">legibus absoluti</span></span>, and their
            dispensations could always set aside their legislation when it
            suited their purpose. Under these constitutions of Pope John
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">xxii.</span></span>, when sees were
            vacant owing to the invalidation of an election they were
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">reserved</span></em> to the Pope. Thus we
            find that there was a disputed election to the see of Dunkeld in
            1337, and after some years' litigation at Rome the election was
            quashed, and Richard de Pilmor was appointed bishop <span lang=
            "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">auctoritate apostolica</span></span>. The
            see of Dunkeld was declared to be reserved to the Pope for the
            appointment of the two succeeding bishops at least.<a id=
            "noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> This
            system of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reservations</span></span> was gradually
            extended under the successors of Pope John <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">xxii.</span></span>, and was applied
            to benefices of every kind all over Europe, until it would be
            difficult to say what piece of ecclesiastical preferment escaped
            the papal net. There exists in the town library in Trier a MS. of
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Rules of the Roman Chancery</span></span> on
            which someone has sketched the head of a Pope, with the legend
            issuing from the mouth, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Reservamus
            omnia</span></span>, which somewhat roughly represents the
            contents of the book. In the end, the assertion was made that the
            Holy See owned all benefices, and, in the universal
            secularisation of the Church which the half century before the
            Reformation witnessed, the very Rules of the Roman Chancery
            contained the lists of prices to be charged for various
            benefices, whether with or without cure of souls; and in
            completing the bargain the purchaser could always procure a
            clause setting aside the civil rights of patrons.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
            hand, ecclesiastical preferments always implied the holders being
            liferented in lands and in monies, and the right to bestow these
            temporalities was protected by the laws of most European
            countries. Thus the ever-extending papal <span class=

            to continual conflicts between the laws of the Church—in this
            case latterly the Rules of the Roman Chancery—and the laws of the
            European States. Temporal rulers sought to <span class=

            else made bargains with the Popes, which took the form of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Concordats</span></span>, like that of
            Bourges (1438) and that of Vienna (1448). Neither statutes nor
            bargains were of much avail against the superior diplomacy of the
            Papacy, and the dread which its supposed possession of spiritual
            powers inspired in all classes of people. A Concordat was always
            represented by papal lawyers to be binding only so long as the
            goodwill of the Pope maintained it; and there was a deep-seated
            feeling throughout the peoples of Europe that the Church was, to
            use the language of the peasants of Germany, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the Pope's House,”</span> and that he had a right to
            deal freely with its property. Pious and patriotic men, like
            Gascoigne in England, deplored the evil effects of the papal
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">reservations</span></span>; but they saw no
            remedy unless the Almighty changed the heart of the Holy Father;
            and, after the failures of the Conciliar attempts at reform, a
            sullen hopelessness seemed to have taken possession of the minds
            of men, until Luther taught them that there was nothing in the
            indefinable power that the Pope and the clergy claimed to possess
            over the spiritual and eternal welfare of men and women.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To Pope John
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            belongs the credit or discredit of creating for the Papacy a
            machinery for gathering in money for its support. His situation
            rendered this almost inevitable. On his accession he found
            himself with an empty treasury; he had to incur debts in order to
            live; he had to provide for a costly war with the Visconti; and
            he had to leave money to enable his successors to carry out his
            temporal policy. Few Popes lived so plainly; his money-getting
            was not for personal luxury, but for the supposed requirements of
            the papal policy. He was the first Pope who systematically made
            the dispensation of grace, temporal and eternal, a source of
            revenue. Hitherto the charges made by the papal Chancery had
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name=

            at least, for actual work done—fees for clerking and
            registration, and so on. John made the fees proportionate to the
            grace dispensed, or to the power of the recipient to pay. He and
            his successors made the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Tithe</span></span>—a tenth of all
            ecclesiastical incomes for the service of the Papacy—had been
            levied occasionally for extraordinary purposes, such as crusades.
            It was still supposed to be levied for special purposes only, but
            necessary occasions became almost continuous, and the exactions
            were fiercely resented. When Alexander <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vi.</span></span> levied the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Tithe</span></span> in 1500, he was allowed
            to do so in England. The French clergy, however, refused to pay;
            they were excommunicated; the University of Paris declared the
            excommunication unlawful, and the Pope had to withdraw.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Annates</span></span> were an ancient
            charge. From the beginning of the twelfth century the incoming
            incumbent of a benefice had to pay over his first year's income
            for local uses, such as the repairs on ecclesiastical buildings,
            or as a solatium to the heirs of the deceased incumbent. From the
            beginning of the thirteenth century prelates and princes were
            sometimes permitted by the Popes to exact it of entrants into
            benefices. One of the earliest recorded instances was when the
            Archbishop of Canterbury was allowed to use the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Annates</span></span> of his province for a
            period of seven years from 1245, for the purpose of liquidating
            the debts on his cathedral church. Pope John <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">xxii.</span></span> began to
            appropriate them for the purposes of the Papacy. His predecessor
            Clement <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">v.</span></span> (1305-1314) had
            demanded all the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Annates</span></span> of England and
            Scotland for a period of three years from 1316. In 1316 John made
            a much wider demand, and in terms which showed that he was
            prepared to regard the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Annates</span></span> as a permanent tax for
            the general purposes of the Papacy. It is difficult to trace the
            stages of the gradual universal enforcement of this tax; but in
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name=
            "Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the decades before
            the Reformation it was commonly imposed, and averages had been
            struck as to its amount.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11"

            <span class="tei tei-q">“They consisted of a portion, usually
            computed at one-half, of the estimated revenue of all benefices
            worth more than 25 florins. Thus the archbishopric of Rouen was
            taxed at 12,000 florins, and the little see of Grenoble at 300;
            the great abbacy of St. Denis at 6000, and the little St. Ciprian
            Poictiers at 33; while all the parish cures in France were
            uniformly rated at 24 ducats, equivalent to about 30
            florins.”</span> Archbishoprics were subject to a special tax as
            the price of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Pallium</span></span>, and this was often
            very large.</p>

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Procurationes</span></span> were the
            charges, commuted to money payments, which bishops and
            archdeacons were authorised to make for their personal expenses
            while on their tours of visitation throughout their dioceses. The
            Popes began by demanding a share, and ended by often claiming the
            whole of these sums.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pope John
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">xxii.</span></span> was the first to
            require that the incomes of vacant benefices (<span lang="la"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">medii fructus</span></span>) should be paid
            over to the papal treasury during the vacancies. The earliest
            instance dates from 1331, when a demand was made for the income
            of the vacant archbishopric of Gran in Hungary; and it soon
            became the custom to insist that the stipends of all vacant
            benefices should be paid into the papal treasury.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, the
            Popes declared it to be their right to require special
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">subsidies</span></span> from ecclesiastical
            provinces, and great pressure was put on the people to pay these
            so-called free-will offerings.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
            sums which poured into the papal treasury from these regular
            sources of income, irregular sources afforded still larger
            amounts of money. Countless dispensations were issued on payment
            of fees for all manner of breaches of canonical and moral
            law—dispensations for marriages within the prohibited degrees,
            for holding pluralities, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> for acquiring unjust gains in trade or
            otherwise. This demoralising traffic made the Roman treasury the
            partner in all kinds of iniquitous actions, and Luther, in his
            address <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">To the Nobility of the German Nation
            respecting the Reformation of the Christian Estate</span></span>,
            could fitly describe the Court of the Roman Curia as a place
            <span class="tei tei-q">“where vows were annulled, where the monk
            gets leave to quit his Order, where priests can enter the married
            life for money, where bastards can become legitimate, and
            dishonour and shame may arrive at high honours; all evil repute
            and disgrace is knighted and ennobled.”</span> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“There is,”</span> he adds, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“a buying and a selling, a changing, blustering and
            bargaining, cheating and lying, robbing and stealing, debauchery
            and villainy, and all kinds of contempt of God that Antichrist
            could not reign worse.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vast sums
            of money obtained in these ways do not represent the whole of the
            funds which flowed from all parts of Europe into the papal
            treasury. The Roman Curia was the highest court of appeal for the
            whole Church of the West. In any case this involved a large
            amount of law business, with the inevitable legal expenses; but
            the Curia managed to attract to itself a large amount of business
            which might have been easily settled in the episcopal or
            metropolitan courts. This was done in pursuance of a double
            policy—an ecclesiastical and a financial one. The half century
            before the Reformation saw the overthrow of feudalism and the
            consolidation of kingly absolutism, and something similar was to
            be seen in the Papacy as well as among the principalities of
            Europe. Just as the kingly absolutism triumphed when the
            hereditary feudal magnates lost their power, so papal absolutism
            could only become an accomplished fact when it could trample upon
            an episcopate deprived of its ecclesiastical independence and
            inherent powers of ruling and judging. The Episcopate was
            weakened in many ways,—by exempting abbacies from episcopal
            control, by encouraging the mendicant monks to become the rivals
            of the parish clergy, and so on,—but the most potent method of
            degrading <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg
            015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            it was by encouraging people with ecclesiastical complaints to
            pass by the episcopal courts and to carry their cases directly to
            the Pope. Nationalities, men were told, had no place within the
            Catholic Church. Rome was the common fatherland, and the Pope the
            universal bishop and judge ordinary. His judgment, which was
            always final, could be had directly. In this way men were enticed
            to take their pleas straight to the Pope. No doubt this involved
            sending a messenger to Italy with a statement of the plea and a
            request for a hearing; but it did not necessarily involve that
            the trial should take place at Rome. The central power could
            delegate its authority, and the trial could take place wherever
            the Pope might appoint. But the conception undoubtedly did
            increase largely the business of the courts actually held in
            Rome, and caused a flow of money to the imperial city. The Popes
            were also ready to lend monies to impoverished litigants, for
            which, of course, heavy interest was charged.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The immense
            amount of business which was thus directed into the papal
            chancery from all parts of Europe required a horde of officials,
            whose salaries were provided partly from the incomes of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">reserved</span></span> benefices all over
            Europe, and partly from the fees and bribes of the litigants. The
            papal law-courts were notoriously dilatory, rapacious, and venal.
            Every document had to pass through an incredible number of hands,
            and pay a corresponding number of fees; and the costs of suits,
            heavy enough according to the prescribed rule of the chancery,
            were increased immensely beyond the regular charges by others
            which did not appear on the official tables. Cases are on record
            where the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">briefs</span></span> obtained cost from
            twenty-four to forty-one times the amount of the legitimate
            official charges. The Roman Church had become a law-court, not of
            the most reputable kind,—an arena of rival litigants, a chancery
            of writers, notaries, and tax-gatherers,—where transactions about
            privileges, dispensations, buying of benefices, etc., were
            carried on, and where suitors went wandering with their petitions
            from the door of one office to another.</p><span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the
            half century which preceded the Reformation, things went from bad
            to worse. The fears aroused by the attempts at a reform through
            General Councils had died down, and the Curia had no desire to
            reform itself. The venality and rapacity increased when Popes
            began to sell offices in the papal court. Boniface <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">ix.</span></span> (1389-1404) was the
            first to raise money by selling these official posts to the
            highest bidders. <span class="tei tei-q">“In 1483, when Sixtus
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">iv.</span></span> (1471-1484) desired
            to redeem his tiara and jewels, pledged for a loan of 100,000
            ducats, he increased his secretaries from six to twenty-four, and
            required each to pay 2600 florins for the office. In 1503, to
            raise funds for Cæsar Borgia, Alexander <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vi.</span></span> (1492-1503) created
            eighty new offices, and sold them for 760 ducats apiece. Julius
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span> formed a
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘college’</span> of one hundred and one
            scriveners of papal briefs, in return for which they paid him
            74,000 ducats. Leo <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">x.</span></span> (1513-1521) appointed
            sixty chamberlains and a hundred and forty squires, with certain
            perquisites, for which the former paid him 90,000 ducats and the
            latter 112,000. Places thus paid for were personal property,
            transferable on sale. Burchard tells us that in 1483 he bought
            the mastership of ceremonies from his predecessor Patrizzi for
            450 ducats, which covered all expenses; that in 1505 he vainly
            offered Julius <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            ducats for a vacant scrivenership, and that soon after he bought
            the succession to an abbreviatorship for 2040.”</span><a id=

            especially those taken from the clergy of Europe, were so
            obnoxious that it was often hard to collect them, and devices
            were used which in the end increased the burdens of those who
            were required to provide the money. The papal court made bargains
            with the temporal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg

            Popes agreed that the kings or princes could seize the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Tithes</span></span> or <span class=

            "font-style: italic">Annates</span></span> for a prescribed time
            provided the papal officials had their authority to collect them,
            as a rule, for Roman use. In the decades before the Reformation
            it was the common practice to collect these dues by means of
            agents, often bankers, whose charges were enormous, amounting
            sometimes to fifty per cent. The collection of such extraordinary
            sources of revenue as the Indulgences was marked by even worse
            abuses, such as the employment of pardon-sellers, who overran
            Europe, and whose lies and extortions were the common theme of
            the denunciations of the greatest preachers and patriots of the
            times.</p>

            Papacy of the closing decades of the fifteenth and of the first
            quarter of the sixteenth century was the open sore of Europe, and
            the object of execrations by almost all contemporary writers. Its
            abuses found no defenders, and its partisans in attacking
            assailants contented themselves with insisting upon the necessity
            for the spiritual supremacy of the Bishops of Rome.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the
            period of the Reformation a small portion of the world belonged
            to Christendom, and of that only a part was affected, either
            really or nominally, by the movement. The Christians belonging to
            the Greek Church were entirely outside its influence.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Christendom
            had shrunk greatly since the seventh century. The Saracens and
            their successors in Moslem sovereignty had overrun and conquered
            many lands which had formerly been inhabited by a Christian
            population and governed by Christian rulers. Palestine, Syria,
            Asia Minor, Egypt, and North Africa westwards to the Straits of
            Gibraltar, had once been Christian, and had been lost to
            Christendom during the seventh and eighth centuries. The Moslems
            had invaded Europe in the West, had conquered the Spanish
            Peninsula, had passed the Pyrenees, and had invaded France. They
            were met and defeated in a three days' battle at Tours (732) by
            the Franks under Charles the Hammer, the grandfather of Charles
            the Great. After they had been thrust back beyond the Pyrenees,
            the Spanish Peninsula was the scene of a struggle between Moslem
            and Christian which lasted for more than seven hundred years, and
            Spain did not become wholly Christian until the last decade of
            the fifteenth century.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the tide of
            Moslem conquest had been early checked in the West, in the East
            it had flowed steadily if slowly. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            "tei tei-anchor"></a> In 1338, Orchan, Sultan of the Ottoman
            Turks, seized on Gallipoli, the fortified town which guarded the
            eastern entrance to the Dardanelles, and the Moslems won a
            footing on European soil. A few years later the troops of his son
            Murad <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">i.</span></span> had seized a portion
            of the Balkan peninsula, and had cut off Constantinople from the
            rest of Christendom. A hundred years after, Constantinople (1453)
            had fallen, the Christian population had been slain or enslaved,
            the great church of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Holy Wisdom</span></span> (St. Sophia) had
            been made a Mohammedan mosque, and the city had become the
            metropolis of the wide-spreading empire of the Ottoman Turks.
            Servia, Bosnia, Herzogovina (the Duchy, from <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Herzog</span></span>, a Duke), Greece, the
            Peloponnesus, Roumania, Wallachia, and Moldavia were incorporated
            in the Moslem Empire. Belgrade and the island of Rhodes, the two
            bulwarks of Christendom, had fallen. Germany was threatened by
            Turkish invasions, and for years the bells tolled in hundreds of
            German parishes calling the people to pray against the coming of
            the Turk. It was not until the heroic defence of Vienna, in 1529,
            that the victorious advance of the Moslem was stayed. Only the
            Adriatic separated Italy from the Ottoman Empire, and the great
            mountain wall with the strip of Dalmatian coast which lies at its
            foot was the bulwark between civilisation and barbarism.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Western
            Europe, and within the limits affected directly or indirectly by
            the Reformation, the distinctive political characteristic of the
            times immediately preceding the movement was consolidation or
            coalescence. Feudalism, with its liberties and its lawlessness,
            was disappearing, and compact nations were being formed under
            monarchies which tended to become absolute. If the Scandinavian
            North be excluded, five nations included almost the whole field
            of Western European life, and in all of them the principle of
            consolidation is to be seen at work. In three, England, France,
            and Spain, there emerged great united <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class=

            there was no clustering of the people round one dynasty, the same
            principle of coalescence showed itself in the formation of
            permanent States which had all the appearance of modern
            kingdoms.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the time
            that the Duke of Richmond had ascended the English throne and
            ruled with <span class="tei tei-q">“politic governance”</span> as
            Henry <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vii.</span></span>, the distinctively
            modern history of England had begun. Feudalism had perished on
            the field of the battle of Bosworth. The visitations of the Black
            Death, the gigantic agricultural labour strike under Wat Tylor
            and priest Ball, and the consequent transformation of peasant
            serfs into a free people working for wages, had created a new
            England ready for the changes which were to bridge the chasm
            between mediæval and modern history. The consolidation of the
            people was favoured by the English custom that the younger sons
            of the nobility ranked as commoners, and that the privileges as
            well as the estates went to the eldest sons. This kept the
            various classes of the population from becoming stereotyped into
            castes, as in Germany, France, and Spain. It tended to create an
            ever-increasing middle class, which was not confined to the
            towns, but permeated the country districts also. The younger sons
            of the nobility descended into this middle class, and the
            transformation of the serfs into a wage-earning class enabled
            some of them to rise into it. England was the first land to
            become a compact nationality.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The earlier
            portion of the reign of Henry <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vii.</span></span> was not free from
            attempts which, if successful, would have thrown the country back
            into the old condition of disintegration. Although the king
            claimed to unite the rival lines of York and Lancaster, the
            Yorkists did not cease to raise difficulties at home which were
            eagerly fostered from abroad. Ireland <span class="tei tei-pb"

            dowager Duchess of Burgundy, the sister of Edward <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">iv.</span></span>, exercised a
            sufficiently powerful influence in Flanders to make that land a
            centre of Yorkist intrigue.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lambert
            Simnel, a pretender who claimed to be either the son or the
            nephew of Edward <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">iv.</span></span> (his account of
            himself varied), appeared in Ireland, and the whole island
            gathered round him. He invaded England, drew to his standard many
            of the old Yorkists, but was defeated at Stoke-on-Trent in 1487.
            This was really a formidable rebellion. The rising under Perkin
            Warbeck, a young Burgundian from Tournay, though supported by
            Margaret of Burgundy and James <span class=

            more easily suppressed. A popular revolt against severe taxation
            was subdued in 1497, and it may be said that Henry's home
            difficulties were all over by the year 1500. England entered the
            sixteenth century as a compact nation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foreign
            policy of Henry <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vii.</span></span> was alliance with
            Spain and a long-sighted attempt to secure Scotland by peaceful
            means. It had for consequences two marriages which had
            far-reaching results. The marriage of Henry's daughter Margaret
            with James <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">iv.</span></span> of Scotland led to
            the union of the two crowns three generations later; and that
            between Katharine, the third daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella
            of Spain, and the son of Henry <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vii.</span></span> came to be the
            occasion, if not the cause, of the revolt of England from Rome.
            Katharine was married to Arthur, Prince of Wales, in 1501
            (November 14th). Prince Arthur died on January 14th, 1502. After
            protracted negotiation, lengthened by the unwillingness of the
            Pope (Pius <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">iii.</span></span>) to grant a
            dispensation, Katharine was contracted to Henry, and the marriage
            took place in the year of Prince Henry's accession to the crown.
            Katharine and Henry were crowned together at Westminster on June
            28th, 1509.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">England had
            prospered during the reign of the first Tudor sovereign. The
            steady increase in wool-growing and wool-exporting is in itself

            capitalists shows that money had become the possession of all

            adventurers proves that England was taking her share in the
            world-trade of the new era. English scholars like Grocyn and

            been followed there by John Colet, who caught the spirit of the

            religious revival from Savonarola's work in Florence. The country

            at the same date that nowhere was the central authority of the
            sovereign more firmly established. Many things had worked for
            this state of matters. The Hundred Years' War with England did
            for France what the wars against the Moors had done for Spain. It
            had created a sense of nationality. It had also made necessary

            display its inefficiency to help the nation in its sorest need.
            The one thing which was able to stand the storms and stress of
            the time was the kingly authority, and this in spite of the
            incapacity of the man who possessed it. The reign of Charles
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vii.</span></span> had made it plain
            that England was not destined to remain in possession of French
            territory; and the succeeding reigns had seen the central
            authority slowly acquiring irresistible strength. Charles

            pressure and sitting still when he could—by his inactivity,
            perhaps masterly,—Louis <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            unscrupulous craft, Anne of Beaujeu (his daughter) by her clear
            insight and prompt decision, had not only laid the foundations,
            but built up and consolidated the edifice of absolute monarchy in
            France. The kingly power had subdued the great nobles and
            feudatories; it had to a large extent mastered the Church; it had
            consolidated the towns and made them props to its power; and it
            had made itself the direct lord of the peasants.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The work of
            consolidation had been as rapid as it was complete. In 1464,
            three years after his succession, Louis <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">xi.</span></span> was confronted by a
            formidable association of the great feudatories of France, which
            called itself the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">League of Public Weal</span></span>. Charles
            of Guyenne, the king's brother, the Count of Charolais (known as
            Charles the Bold of Burgundy), the Duke of Brittany, the two
            great families of the Armagnacs, the elder represented by the
            Count of Armagnac, and the younger by the Duke of Nemours, John
            of Anjou, Duke of Calabria, and the Duke of Bourbon, were allied
            in arms against the king. Yet by 1465 Normandy had been wrested
            from the Duke of Guyenne; Guyenne itself had become the king's in
            1472; the Duke of Nemours had been crushed and slain in 1476; the
            Count of Charolais, become Duke of Burgundy, had been overthrown,
            his power shattered, and himself slain by the Swiss peasant
            confederates, and almost all his French <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fiefs</span></em>
            had been incorporated by 1480; and on the death of King René
            (1480) the provinces of Anjou and Provence had been annexed to
            the Crown of France. The great feudatories were so thoroughly
            broken that their attempt to revolt during the earlier years of
            the reign of Charles <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">viii.</span></span> was easily
            frustrated by Anne of Beaujeu acting on behalf of the young
            king.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The efforts to
            secure hold on the Church date back from the days of the Council
            of Basel, when Pope Eugenius was at hopeless issue with the
            majority of its members. In 1438 a deputation from the Council
            waited upon the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg
            024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            king and laid before him the conciliar plans of reform. Charles
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vii.</span></span> summoned an
            assembly of the French clergy to meet at Bourges. He was present
            himself with his principal nobles; and the meeting was also
            attended by members of the Council and by papal delegates. There
            the celebrated Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges was formally
            presented and agreed upon.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Pragmatic
            Sanction embodied most of the cherished conciliar plans of
            reform. It asserted the ecclesiastical supremacy of Councils over
            Popes. It demanded a meeting of a Council every ten years. It
            declared that the selection of the higher ecclesiastics was to be
            left to the Chapters and to the Convents. It denied the Pope's
            general claim to the reservation of benefices, and greatly
            limited its use in special cases. It did away with the Pope's
            right to act as Ordinary, and insisted that no ecclesiastical
            cases should be appealed to Rome without first having exhausted
            the lower courts of jurisdiction. It abolished the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Annates</span></span>, with some exceptions
            in favour of the present Pope. It also made some attempts to
            provide the churches with an educated ministry. All these
            declarations simply carried out the proposals of the Council of
            Basel; but they had an important influence on the position of the
            French clergy towards the king. The Pragmatic Sanction, though
            issued by an assembly of the French clergy, was nevertheless a
            royal ordinance, and thereby gave the king indefinite rights over
            the Church within France. The right to elect bishops and abbots
            was placed in the hands of Chapters and Convents, but the king
            and nobles were expressly permitted to bring forward and
            recommend candidates, and this might easily be extended to
            enforcing the election of those recommended. Indefinite rights of
            patronage on the part of the king and of the nobles over
            benefices in France could not fail to be the result, and the
            French Church could scarcely avoid assuming the appearance of a
            national Church controlled by the king as the head of the State.
            The abolition of the Pragmatic Sanction was always a bait which
            the French king could dangle <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> before the eyes of the Pope, and the
            promise to maintain the Pragmatic Sanction was always a bribe to
            secure the support of the clergy and the <span lang="fr" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Parlements</span></span> of France.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1516,
            Francis <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">i.</span></span> and Leo <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">x.</span></span> agreed on a
            Concordat, the practical effect of which was that the king
            received the right to nominate to almost all the higher vacant
            benefices in France, while the Popes received the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Annates</span></span>. The results were not
            beneficial to the Church. It left the clergy a prey to papal
            exactions, and it compelled them to seek for promotion through
            subserviency to the king and the court; but it had the effect of
            ranging the monarch on the side of the Papacy when the
            Reformation came.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It can
            scarcely be said that France was a compact nation. The nobility
            were separated from the middle and lower classes by the fact that
            all younger sons retained the status and privileges of nobles. In
            ancient times they had paid no share of the taxes raised for war,
            on the ground that they rendered personal service, and the
            privilege of being free from taxation was retained long after the
            services of a feudal militia had disappeared. The nobility in
            France became a caste, numerous, poor in many instances, and too
            proud to belittle themselves by entering any of the professions
            or engaging in commerce.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Louis
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">xi.</span></span> had done his best to
            encourage trade, and had introduced the silkworm industry into
            France. But as the whole weight of taxation fell upon the rural
            districts, the middle classes took refuge in the towns, and the
            peasantry, between the dues they had to pay to their lords and
            the taxation for the king, were in an oppressed condition. Their
            grievances were set forth in the petition they addressed, in the
            delusive hope of amelioration, to the States-General which
            assembled on the accession of Charles <span class=

            cottage, eating him up. In Normandy, multitudes have died of
            hunger. From want of cattle, men and women have to yoke
            themselves to the carts; and others, fearing that if seen in the

            This was in 1483, before the Italian wars had further increased
            the burdens which the poorest class of the community had to
            pay.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The New
            Learning had begun to filter into France at a comparatively early
            date. In 1458 an Italian of Greek descent had been appointed to
            teach Greek by the University of Paris. But that University had
            been for long the centre of mediæval scholastic study, and it was
            not until the Italian campaigns of Charles <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">viii.</span></span>, who was in Italy
            when the Renaissance was at its height, that France may be said
            to have welcomed the Humanist movement. A Greek Press was
            established in Paris in 1507, a group of French Humanists entered
            upon the study of the authors of classical antiquity, and the new
            learning gradually displaced the old scholastic disciplines.
            French Humanists were perhaps the earliest to make a special
            study of Roman Law, and to win distinction as eminent jurists.
            Francis, like Henry <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">viii.</span></span> of England, was
            welcomed on his accession as a Humanist king. Such was the
            condition of France in the beginning of the sixteenth
            century.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Spain had for
            centuries been under Mohammedan domination. The Moslems had
            overrun almost the whole country, and throughout its most fertile
            provinces the Christian peasantry lived under masters of an alien
            faith. At the beginning of the tenth century the only independent
            Christian principalities were small states lying along the
            southern shore of the Bay of Biscay and the south-western slopes
            of the Pyrenees. The Gothic and Vandal chiefs slowly <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id=
            "Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> recovered the northern
            districts, while the Moors retained the more fertile provinces of
            the south. The political conditions of the country at the close
            of the fifteenth century inevitably reflected this gradual
            reconquest, which had brought the Christian principalities into
            existence. In 1474, when Isabella (she had been married in 1469
            to Ferdinand, the heir to Aragon) succeeded her brother Henry
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">iv.</span></span> in the sovereignty
            of Castile, Spain was divided into five separate principalities:
            Castile, with Leon, containing 62 per cent.; Aragon, with
            Valentia and Catalonia, containing 15 per cent.; Portugal,
            containing 20 per cent.; Navarre, containing 1 per cent.; and
            Granada, the only remaining Moslem State, containing 2 per cent.
            of the entire surface of the country.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Castile had
            grown by almost continuous conquest of lands from the Moslems,
            and these additions were acquired in many ways. If they had been
            made in what may be termed a national war, the lands seized
            became the property of the king, and could be retained by him or
            granted to his lords spiritual and temporal under varying
            conditions. In some cases these grants made the possessors almost
            independent princes. On the other hand, lands might be wrested
            from the aliens by private adventurers, and in such cases they
            remained in possession of the conquerors, who formed
            municipalities which had the right of choosing and of changing
            their overlords, and really formed independent communities. Then
            there were, as was natural in a period of continuous warfare,
            waste lands. These became the property of those who settled on
            them. Lastly, there were the dangerous frontier lands, which it
            was the policy of king or great lord who owned them to people
            with settlers, who could only be induced to undertake the
            perilous occupation provided they received charters (<span lang=
            "es" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="es"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">fueros</span></span>), which guaranteed
            their practical independence. In such a condition of things the
            central authority could not be strong. It was further weakened by
            the fact that the great feudatories claimed to have both civil
            administration and military rule over their lands, and assumed an
            almost <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg
            028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            regal state. Military religious orders abounded, and were
            possessed of great wealth. Their Grand Masters, in virtue of
            their office, were independent military commanders, and had great
            gifts, in the shape of rich commandries, to bestow on their
            followers. Their power overshadowed that of the sovereign. The
            great ecclesiastics, powerful feudal lords in virtue of their
            lands, claimed the rights of civil administration and military
            rule like their lay compeers, and, being personally protected by
            the indefinable sanctity of the priestly character, were even
            more turbulent. Almost universal anarchy had prevailed during the
            reigns of the two weak kings who preceded Isabella on the throne
            of Castile, and the crown lands, the support and special
            protection of the sovereign, had been alienated by lavish gifts
            to the great nobles. This was the situation which faced the young
            queen when she came into her inheritance. It was aggravated by a
            rebellion on behalf of Juanna, the illegitimate daughter of Henry
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">iv.</span></span> The rebellion was
            successfully crushed. The queen and her consort, who was not yet
            in possession of the throne of Aragon, then tried to give the
            land security. The previous anarchy had produced its usual
            results. The country was infested with bands of brigands, and
            life was not safe outside the walls of the towns. Isabella
            instituted, or rather revived, the Holy Brotherhood (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Hermandad</span></span>), a force of cavalry
            raised by the whole country (each group of one hundred houses was
            bound to provide one horseman). It was an army of mounted police.
            It had its own judges, who tried criminals on the scene of their
            crimes, and those convicted were punished by the troops according
            to the sentences pronounced. Its avowed objects were to put down
            all crimes of violence committed outside the cities, and to hunt
            criminals who had fled from the towns' justice. Its judges
            superseded the justiciary powers of the nobles, who protested in
            vain. The Brotherhood did its work very effectively, and the
            towns and the common people rallied round the monarchy which had
            given them safety for limb and property.</p><span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id=
            "Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sovereigns
            next attacked the position of the nobles, whose mutual feuds
            rendered them a comparatively easy foe to rulers who had proved
            their strength of government. The royal domains, which had been
            alienated during the previous reign, were restored to the
            sovereign, and many of the most abused privileges of the nobility
            were curtailed.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One by one the
            Grand Masterships of the Crusading Orders were centred in the
            person of the Crown, the Pope acquiescing and granting
            investiture. The Church was stripped of some of its superfluous
            wealth, and the civil powers of the higher ecclesiastics were
            abolished or curtailed. In the end it may be said that the
            Spanish clergy were made almost as subservient to the sovereign
            as were those of France.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            pacification and consolidation of Castile was followed by the
            conquest of Granada. The Holy Brotherhood served the purpose of a
            standing army, internal feuds among the Moors aided the
            Christians, and after a protracted struggle (1481-1492) the city
            of Granada was taken, and the Moorish rule in the Peninsula
            ceased. All Spain, save Portugal and Navarre (seized by Ferdinand
            in 1512), was thus united under Ferdinand and Isabella, the
            Catholic Sovereigns as they came to be called, and the civil
            unity increased the desire for religious uniformity. The Jews in
            Spain were numerous, wealthy, and influential. They had
            intermarried with many noble families, and almost controlled the
            finance of the country. It was resolved to compel them to become
            Christians, by force if necessary. In 1478 a Bull was obtained
            from Pope Sixtus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">iv.</span></span> establishing the
            Inquisition in Spain, it being provided that the inquisitors were
            to be appointed by the sovereign. The Holy Office in this way
            became an instrument for establishing a civil despotism, as well
            as a means for repressing heresy. It did its work with a ruthless
            severity hitherto unexampled. Sixtus himself and some of his
            successors, moved by repeated complaints, endeavoured to restrain
            its savage energy; but the Inquisition <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> was too useful an instrument in the hands
            of a despotic sovereign, and the Popes were forced to allow its
            proceedings, and to refuse all appeals to Rome against its
            sentences. It was put in use against the Moorish subjects of the
            Catholic kings, notwithstanding the terms of the capitulation of
            Granada, which provided for the exercise of civil and religious
            liberty. The result was that, in spite of fierce rebellions, all
            the Moors, save small groups of families under the special
            protection of the Crown, had become nominal Christians by 1502,
            although almost a century had to pass before the Inquisition had
            rooted out the last traces of the Moslem faith in the Spanish
            Peninsula.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The death of
            Isabella in 1504 roughly dates a formidable rising against this
            process of repression and consolidation. The severities of the
            Inquisition, the insistence of Ferdinand to govern personally the
            lands of his deceased wife, and many local causes led to
            widespread conspiracies and revolts against his rule. The years
            between 1504 and 1522 were a period of revolutions and of
            lawlessness which was ended when Charles <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">v.</span></span>, the grandson of
            Ferdinand and Isabella, overcame all resistance and inaugurated a
            reign of personal despotism which long distinguished the kingdom
            of Spain. Spanish troubles had something to do with preventing
            Charles from putting into execution in Germany, as he wished to
            do, the ban issued at Worms against Martin Luther.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 120%">§ 6. Germany and Italy.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Germany and
            Italy, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, had made almost
            no progress in becoming united and compact nations. The process
            of national consolidation, which was a feature of the times,
            displayed itself in these lands in the creation of compact
            principalities rather than in a great and effective national
            movement under one sovereign power. It is a commonplace of
            history to say that the main reason for this was the presence
            within these two lands of the Pope and the Emperor, the twin
            powers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg
            031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            of the earlier mediæval ideal of a dual government, at once civil
            and ecclesiastical. Machiavelli expressed the common idea in his
            clear and strenuous fashion. He says that the Italians owe it to
            Rome that they are divided into factions and not united as were
            Spain and France. The Pope, he explains, who claimed temporal as
            well as spiritual jurisdiction, though not strong enough to rule
            all Italy by himself, was powerful enough to prevent any other
            Italian dynasty from taking his place. Whenever he saw any
            Italian power growing strong enough to have a future before it,
            he invited the aid of some foreign potentate, thus making Italy a
            prey to continual invasions. The shadowy lordship of the Pope was
            sufficient, in the opinion of Machiavelli, to prevent any real
            lordship under a native dynasty within the Italian peninsula. In
            Germany there was a similar impotency. The German king was the
            Emperor, the mediæval head of the Holy Roman Empire, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“king of the Romans.”</span> Some idea of
            what underlay the thought and its expression may be had when one
            reads across Albert Dürer's portrait of Maximilian, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Imperator Cæsar Divus Maximilianus Pius Felix
            Augustus,”</span> just as if he had been Trajan or Constantine.
            The phrase carries us back to the times when the Teutonic tribes
            swept down on the Roman possessions in Western Europe and took
            possession of them. They were barbarians with an unalterable
            reverence for the wider civilisation of the great Empire which
            they had conquered. They crept into the shell of the great Empire
            and tried to assimilate its jurisprudence and its religion. Hence
            it came to pass, in the earlier Middle Ages, as Mr. Freeman says,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The two great powers in Western Europe
            were the Church and the Empire, and the centre of each, in
            imagination at least, was Rome. Both of these went on through the
            settlements of the German nations, and both in a manner drew new
            powers from the change of things. Men believed more than ever
            that Rome was the lawful and natural centre of the world. For it
            was held that there were of divine right two Vicars of God upon
            earth, the Roman Emperor, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> His Vicar in temporal things, and the Roman
            Bishop, His Vicar in spiritual things. This belief did not
            interfere with the existence either of separate commonwealths,
            principalities, or of national Churches. But it was held that the
            Roman Emperor, who was the Lord of the World, was of right the
            head of all temporal States, and the Roman Bishop, the Pope, was
            the head of all the Churches.”</span> This idea was a devout
            imagination, and was never actually and fully expressed in fact.
            No Eastern nation or Church ever agreed with it; and the temporal
            lordship of the Emperors was never completely acknowledged even
            in the West. Still it ruled in men's minds with all the force of
            an ideal. As the modern nations of Europe came gradually into
            being, the real headship of the Emperor became more and more
            shadowy. But both headships could prevent the national
            consolidation of the countries, Germany and Italy, in which the
            possessors dwelt. All this is, as has been said, a commonplace of
            history, and, like all commonplaces, it contains a great deal of
            truth. Still it may be questioned whether the mediæval idea was
            solely responsible for the disintegration of either Germany or
            Italy in the sixteenth century. A careful study of the conditions
            of things in both countries makes us see that many causes were at
            work besides the mediæval idea—conditions geographical, social,
            and historical. Whatever the causes, the disintegration of these
            two lands was in marked contrast to the consolidation of the
            three other nations.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 120%">§ 7. Italy.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the end of
            the fifteenth century, Italy contained a very great number of
            petty principalities and five States which might be called the
            great powers of Italy—Venice, Milan, and Florence in the north,
            Naples in the south, and the States of the Church in the centre.
            Peace was kept by a delicate and highly artificial balance of
            powers. Venice was a commercial republic, ruled by an oligarchy
            of nobles. The city in the lagoons had been founded by
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name=
            "Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> trembling
            fugitives fleeing before Attila's Huns, and was more than a
            thousand years old. It had large territories on the mainland of
            Italy, and colonies extending down the east coast of the Adriatic
            and among the Greek islands. It had the largest revenue of all
            the Italian States, but its expenses were also much the heaviest.
            Milan came next in wealth, with its yearly income of over 700,000
            ducats. At the close of the century it was in the possession of
            the Sforza family, whose founder had been born a ploughman, and
            had risen to be a formidable commander of mercenary soldiers. It
            was claimed by Maximilian as a fief of the Empire, and by the
            Kings of France as a heritage of the Dukes of Orleans. The
            disputed heritage was one of the causes of the invasion of Italy
            by Charles <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">viii.</span></span> Florence, the most
            cultured city in Italy, was, like Venice, a commercial republic;
            but it was a democratic republic, wherein one family, the Medici,
            had usurped almost despotic power while preserving all the
            external marks of republican rule.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naples was the
            portion of Italy where the feudal system of the Middle Ages had
            lingered longest. The old kingdom of the Two Sicilies (Naples and
            Sicily) had, since 1458, been divided, and Sicily had been
            politically separated from the mainland. The island belonged to
            the King of Aragon; while the mainland had for its ruler the
            illegitimate son of Alphonso of Aragon, Ferdinand, or Ferrante,
            who proved a despotic and masterful ruler. He had crushed his
            semi-independent feudal barons, had brought the towns under his
            despotic rule, and was able to hand over a compact kingdom to his
            son Alphonso in 1494.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The feature,
            however, in the political condition of Italy which illustrated
            best the general tendency of the age towards coalescence, was the
            growth of the States of the Church. The dominions which were
            directly under the temporal power of the Pope had been the most
            disorganised in all Italy. The vassal barons had been turbulently
            independent, and the Popes had little power even within the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name=
            "Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> city of Rome. The
            helplessness of the Popes to control their vassals perhaps
            reached its lowest stage in the days of Innocent <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">viii.</span></span> His successors
            Alexander <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vi.</span></span> (Rodrigo Borgia,
            1492-1503), Julius <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span> (Cardinal della
            Rovere, 1503-1513), and Leo <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">x.</span></span> (Giovanni de Medici,
            1513-1521), strove to create, and partly succeeded in forming, a
            strong central dominion, the States of the Church. The troubled
            times of the French invasions, and the continual warfare among
            the more powerful States of Italy, furnished them with the
            occasion. They pursued their policy with a craft which brushed
            aside all moral obligations, and with a ruthlessness which
            hesitated at no amount of bloodshed. In their hands the Papacy
            appeared to be a merely temporal power, and was treated as such
            by contemporary politicians. It was one of the political States
            of Italy, and the Popes were distinguished from their
            contemporary Italian rulers only by the facts that their
            spiritual position enabled them to exercise a European influence
            which the others could not aspire to, and that their sacred
            character placed them above the obligations of ordinary morality
            in the matter of keeping solemn promises and maintaining treaty
            obligations made binding by the most sacred oaths. In one sense
            their aim was patriotic. They were Italian princes whose aim was
            to create a strong Italian central power which might be able to
            maintain the independence of Italy against the foreigner; and in
            this they were partially successful, whatever judgment may
            require to be passed on the means taken to attain their end. But
            the actions of the Italian prince placed the spiritual Head of
            the Church outside all those influences, intellectual, artistic,
            and religious (the revival under Savonarola in Florence), which
            were working in Italy for the regeneration of European society.
            The Popes of the Renaissance set the example, only too faithfully
            followed by almost every prince of the age, of believing that
            political far outweighed all moral and religious motives.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 120%">§ 8. Germany.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Germany, or
            the Empire, as it was called, included, in the days of the
            Reformation, the Low Countries in the north-west and most of what
            are now the Austro-Hungarian lands in the east. It was in a
            strange condition. On the one hand a strong popular sentiment for
            unity had arisen in all the German-speaking portions, and on the
            other the country was cut into sections and slices, and was more
            hopelessly divided than was Italy itself.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nominally the
            Empire was ruled over by one supreme lord, with a great feudal
            assembly, the Diet, under him.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Empire was
            elective, though for generations the rulers chosen had always
            been the heads of the House of Hapsburg, and since 1356 the
            election had been in the hands of seven prince-electors—three on
            the Elbe and four on the Rhine. On the Elbe were the King of
            Bohemia, the Elector of Saxony, and the Elector of Brandenburg;
            on the Rhine, the Count Palatine of the Rhine and the Archbishops
            of Mainz, Trier, and Köln.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Empire,
            nominally one, and full of the strongest sentiments of unity, was
            hopelessly divided, and—for this was the peculiarity of the
            situation—all the elements making for peaceful government, which
            in countries like France or England supported the central power,
            were on the side of disunion.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A glance at
            the map of Germany in the times of the Reformation shows an
            astonishing multiplicity of separate principalities,
            ecclesiastical and secular, all the more bewildering that most of
            them appeared to be composed of patches lying separate from each
            other. Almost every ruling prince had to cross some neighbour's
            land to visit the outlying portions of his dominions. It must
            also be remembered that the divisions which can be represented on
            a map but faintly express the real state of things. The
            territories of the imperial cities—the lands outside the walls
            ruled by the civic fathers—were for the most part too small to
            figure on any map, and for the same reason <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id=
            "Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the tiny principalities of
            the hordes of free nobles are also invisible. So we have to
            imagine all those little mediæval republics and those
            infinitesimal kingdoms camped on the territories of the great
            princes, and taking from them even the small amount of unity
            which the map shows.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The greater
            feudal States, Electoral and Ducal Saxony, Brandenburg, Bavaria,
            the Palatinate, Hesse, and many others, had meetings of their own
            Estates,—Councils of subservient nobles and lawyers,—their own
            Supreme Courts of Justice, from which there was no appeal, their
            own fiscal system, their own finance and coinage, and largely
            controlled their clergy and their relations to powers outside
            Germany. Their princes, hampered as they were by the great
            Churchmen, thwarted continually by the town republics, defied by
            the free nobles, were nevertheless actual kings, and profited by
            the centralising tendencies of the times. They alone in Germany
            represented settled central government, and attracted to
            themselves the smaller units lying outside and around them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet with all
            these divisions, having their roots deep down in the past, there
            was pervading all classes of society, from princes to peasants,
            the sentiment of a united Germany, and no lack of schemes to
            convert the feeling into fact. The earliest practical attempts
            began with the union of German Churchmen at Constance and the
            scheme for a National Church of Germany; and the dream of
            ecclesiastical unity brought in its train the aspiration after
            political oneness.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The practical
            means proposed to create a German national unity over lands which
            stretched from the Straits of Dover to the Vistula, and from the
            Baltic to the Adriatic, were the proclamation of a universal
            Land's Peace, forbidding all internecine war between Germans; the
            establishment of a Supreme Court of Justice to decide quarrels
            within the Empire; a common coinage, and a common Customs Union.
            To bind all more firmly together there was needed a Common
            Council or governing body, which, under the Emperor, should
            determine the Home <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg
            037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            and Foreign Policy of the Empire. The only authorities which
            could create a governmental unity of this kind were the Emperor
            on the one hand and the great princes on the other, and the two
            needed to be one in mutual confidence and in intention. But that
            is what never happened, and all through the reign of Maximilian
            and in the early years of Charles we find two different
            conceptions of what the central government ought to be—the one
            oligarchic and the other autocratic. The princes were resolved to
            keep their independence, and their plans for unity always implied
            a governing oligarchy with serious restraint placed on the power
            of the Emperor; while the Emperors, who would never submit to be
            controlled by an oligarchy of German princes, and who found that
            they could not carry out their schemes for an autocratic unity,
            were at least able to wreck any other.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The German
            princes have been accused of preferring the security and
            enlargement of their dynastic possessions to the unity of the
            Empire, but it can be replied that in doing so they only followed
            the example set them by their Emperors. Frederick <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">iii.</span></span>, Maximilian, and
            Charles <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">v.</span></span> invariably neglected
            imperial interests when they clashed with the welfare of the
            family possessions of the House of Hapsburg. When Maximilian
            inherited the imperial Burgundian lands, a fief of the Empire,
            through his marriage with Mary, the heiress of Charles the Bold,
            he treated the inheritance as part of the family estates of his
            House. The Tyrol was absorbed by the House of Hapsburg when the
            Swabian League prevented Bavaria seizing it (1487). The same fate
            fell on the Duchy of Austria when Vienna was recovered, and on
            Hungary and Bohemia; and when Charles <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">v.</span></span> got hold of
            Würtemberg on the outlawry of Duke Ulrich, it, too, was detached
            from the Empire and absorbed into the family possessions of the
            Hapsburgs. There was, in short, a persistent policy pursued by
            three successive Emperors, of despoiling the Empire in order to
            increase the family possessions of the House to which they
            belonged.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last
            attempt to give a constitutional unity to the German Empire was
            made at the Diet of Worms (1521)—the Diet before which Luther
            appeared. There the Emperor, Charles V., agreed to accept a
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span>,
            which was in all essential points, though differing in some
            details, the same as his grandfather Maximilian had proposed to
            the Diet of 1495. The Central Council was composed of a President
            and four members appointed by the Emperor, six Electors (the King
            of Bohemia being excluded), who might sit in person or by
            deputies, and twelve members appointed by the rest of the
            Estates. The cities were not represented. This <span lang="de"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span> was to govern
            all German lands, including Austria and the Netherlands, but
            excluding Bohemia. Switzerland, hitherto nominally within the
            Empire, formally withdrew and ceased to form part of Germany. The
            central government needed funds to carry on its work, and
            especially to provide an army to enforce its decisions; and
            various schemes for raising the money required were discussed at
            its earlier meetings. It was resolved at last to raise the
            necessary funds by imposing a tax of four per cent. on all
            imports and exports, and to establish custom-houses on all the
            frontiers. The practical effect of this was to lay the whole
            burden of taxation upon the mercantile classes, or, in other
            words, to make the cities, who were not represented in the
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span>,
            pay for the whole of the central government. This <span lang="de"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span> was to be
            simply a board of advice, without any decisive control so long as
            the Emperor was in Germany. When he was absent from the country
            it had an independent power of government. But all important
            decisions had to be confirmed by the absent Emperor, who, for his
            part, promised to form no foreign leagues involving Germany
            without the consent of the Council.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as the

            had settled its scheme of taxation, the cities on which it was
            proposed to lay the whole burden of providing the funds required
            very naturally objected. They met by representatives at Speyer
            (1523), and sent delegates to Spain, to Valladolid, where
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name=
            "Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Charles happened
            to be, to protest against the scheme of taxation. They were
            supported by the great German capitalists. The Emperor received
            them graciously, and promised to take the government into his own
            hands. In this way the last attempt to give a governmental unity
            to Germany was destroyed by the joint action of the Emperor and
            of the cities. It is unquestionable that the Reformation under
            Luther did seriously assist in the disintegration of Germany, but
            it must be remembered that a movement cannot become national
            where there is no nation, and that German nationality had been
            hopelessly destroyed just at the time when it was most needed to
            unify and moderate the great religious impulses which were
            throbbing in the hearts of its citizens.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Maximilian had
            been elected King of the Romans in 1486, and had succeeded to the
            Empire on the death of his father, Frederick <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">iii.</span></span>, in 1493. His was a
            strongly fascinating personality—a man full of enthusiasms, never
            lacking in ideas, but singularly destitute of the patient
            practical power to make them workable. He may almost be called a
            type of that Germany over which he was called to rule. No man was
            fuller of the longing for German unity as an ideal; no man did
            more to perpetuate the very real divisions of the land.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was the
            patron of German learning and of German art, and won the praises
            of the German Humanists: no ruler was more celebrated in
            contemporary song. He protected and supported the German towns,
            encouraged their industries, and fostered their culture. In
            almost everything ideal he stood for German nationality and
            unity. He placed himself at the head of all those intellectual
            and artistic forces from which spread the thought of a united
            Germany for the Germans. On the other hand, his one persistent
            practical policy, and the only one in which he was almost
            uniformly successful, was to unify and consolidate the family
            possessions of the House of Hapsburg. In this policy he was the
            leader of those who broke up Germany into an aggregate of
            separate and independent <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class=

            followed his example, and did their best to transform themselves
            into the civilised rulers of modern States.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Maximilian
            died somewhat unexpectedly on January 12th, 1519, and five months
            were spent in intrigues by the partisans of Francis of France and
            young Charles, King of Spain, the grandson of Maximilian. The
            French party believed that they had secured by bribery a majority
            of the Electors; and when this was whispered about, the popular
            feeling in favour of Charles, on account of his German blood,
            soon began to manifest itself. It was naturally strongest in the
            Rhine provinces. Papal delegates could not get the Rhine skippers
            to hire boats to them for their journey, as it was believed that
            the Pope favoured the French king. The Imperial Cities accused
            Francis of fomenting internecine war in Germany, and displayed
            their hatred of his candidature. The very Landsknechten clamoured
            for the grandson of their <span class="tei tei-q">“Father”</span>
            Maximilian. The eyes of all Germany were turned anxiously enough
            to the venerable town of Frankfurt-on-the-Main, where, according
            to ancient usage, the Electors met to select the ruler of the
            Holy Roman Empire. On the 28th of June (1519) the alarm bell of
            the town gave the signal, and the Electors assembled in their
            scarlet robes of State in the dim little chapel of St.
            Bartholomew, where the conclave was always held. The
            manifestation of popular feeling had done its work. Charles was
            unanimously chosen, and all Germany rejoiced,—the good burghers
            of Frankfurt declaring that if the Electors had chosen Francis
            they would have been <span class="tei tei-q">“playing with
            death.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a wave
            of national excitement, the desire for a <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">German</span></em> ruler, that had brought
            about the unanimous election; and never were a people more
            mistaken and, in the end, disappointed. Charles was the heir of
            the House of Hapsburg, the grandson of Maximilian, his veins full
            of German blood. But he was no German. Maximilian was the last of
            the real German Hapsburgs. History <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            mother's blood has so completely changed the character of a race.
            Charles was his mother's son, and her Spanish characteristics
            showed themselves in him in greater strength as the years went
            on. When he abdicated, he retired to end his days in a Spanish
            convent. It was the Spaniard, not the German, who faced Luther at
            Worms.</p>

            Mediæval to the Modern World.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The movement
            called the Renaissance, in its widest extent, may be described as
            the transition from the mediæval to the modern world. All our
            present conceptions of life and thought find their roots within
            this period.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It saw the
            beginnings of modern science and the application of true
            scientific methods to the investigation of nature. It witnessed
            the astronomical discoveries of Copernicus and Galileo, the
            foundation of anatomy under <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Vessalius, and the discovery of the
            circulation of the blood by Harvey.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the age
            of geographical explorations. The discoveries of the telescope,
            the mariner's compass, and gunpowder gave men mastery over
            previously unknown natural forces, and multiplied their powers,
            their daring, and their capacities for adventure. When these
            geographical discoveries had made a world-trade a possible thing,
            there began that change from mediæval to modern methods in trade
            and commerce which lasted from the close of the fourteenth to the
            beginning of the seventeenth century, when the modern commercial
            conditions were thoroughly established. The transition period was
            marked by the widening area of trade, which was no longer
            restricted to the Mediterranean, the Black and the North Seas, to
            the Baltic, and to the east coasts of Africa. The rigid groups of
            artisans and traders—the guild system of the Middle Ages—began to
            dissolve, and to leave freer space for individual and new
            corporate effort. Prices were gradually freed from official
            regulation, and became subject to the natural effects of
            bargaining. Adventure companies were started to share in the
            world-trade, and a beginning was made of dealing on commissions.
            All these changes belong to the period of transition between the
            mediæval and the modern world.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the art of
            governing men the Renaissance was the age of political
            concentration. In two realms—Germany and Italy—the mediæval
            conceptions of Emperor and Pope, world-king and world-priest,
            were still strong enough to prevent the union of national forces
            under one political head; but there, also, the principle of
            coalescence may be found in partial operation,—in Germany in the
            formation of great independent principalities, and in Italy in
            the growth of the States of the Church,—and its partial failure
            subjected both nationalities to foreign oppression. Everywhere
            there was the attempt to assert the claims of the secular powers
            to emancipate themselves from clerical tutelage and
            ecclesiastical usurpation. While, underlying <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id=
            "Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> all, there was the beginning
            of the assertion of the supreme right of individual revolt
            against every custom, law, or theory which would subordinate the
            man to the caste or class. The Swiss peasantry began it when they
            made pikes by tying their scythes to their alpenstocks, and,
            standing shoulder to shoulder at Morgarten and Sempach, broke the
            fiercest charges of mediæval knighthood. They proved that man for
            man the peasant was as good as the noble, and individual manhood
            asserted in this rude and bodily fashion soon began to express
            itself mentally and morally.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In
            jurisprudence the Renaissance may be described as the
            introduction of historical and scientific methods, the
            abandonment of legal fictions based upon collections of false
            decretals, the recovery of the true text of the Roman code, and
            the substitution of civil for canon law as the basis of
            legislation and government. There was a complete break with the
            past. The substitution of civil law based upon the lawbooks of
            Justinian for the canon law founded upon the Decretum of Gratian,
            involved such a breach in continuity that it was the most
            momentous of all the changes of that period of transition. For
            law enters into every human relation, and a thorough change of
            legal principles must involve a revolution which is none the less
            real that it works almost silently. The codes of Justinian and of
            Theodosius completely reversed the teachings of the canonists,
            and the civilian lawyers learned to look upon the Church as only
            a department of the State.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In literature
            there was the discovery of classical manuscripts, the
            introduction of the study of Greek, the perception of the
            beauties of language in the choice and arrangement of words under
            the guidance of classical models. The literary powers of modern
            languages were also discovered,—Italian, English, French, and
            German,—and with the discovery the national literatures of Europe
            came into being.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In art a
            complete revolution was effected in architecture, <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id=
            "Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> painting, and sculpture by
            the recovery of ancient models and the study of the principles of
            their construction.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            manufacture of paper, the discovery of the arts of printing and
            engraving, multiplied the possession of the treasures of the
            intelligence and of artistic genius, and combined to make art and
            literature democratic. What was once confined to a favoured few
            became common property. New thoughts could act on men in masses,
            and began to move the multitude. The old mediæval barriers were
            broken down, and men came to see that there was more in religion
            than the mediæval Church had taught, more in social life than
            feudalism had manifested, and that knowledge was a manifold
            unknown to their fathers.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the
            Renaissance be the transition from the mediæval to the modern
            world,—and it is scarcely possible to regard it otherwise,—then
            it is one of those great movements of the mind of mankind that
            almost defy exact description, and there is an elusiveness about
            it which confounds us when we attempt definition. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“It was the emancipation of the reason,”</span> says
            Symonds, <span class="tei tei-q">“in a race of men, intolerant of
            control, ready to criticise canons of conduct, enthusiastic of
            antique liberty, freshly awakened to the sense of beauty, and
            anxious above all things to secure for themselves free scope in
            spheres outside the region of authority. Men so vigorous and
            independent felt the joy of exploration. There was no problem
            they feared to face, no formula they were not eager to recast
            according to their new conceptions.”</span><a id="noteref_17"

            was the blossoming and fructifying of the European intellectual
            life; but perhaps it ought to be added that it contained a new
            conception of the universe in which religion consisted less in a
            feeling of dependence on God, and more in a faith on the
            possibilities lying in mankind.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
            Renaissance has generally a more limited meaning, and one defined
            by the most potent of the new forces which worked for the general
            intellectual regeneration. It means the revival of learning and
            of art consequent on the discovery and study of the literary and
            artistic masterpieces of antiquity. It is perhaps in this more
            limited sense that the movement more directly prepared the way
            for the Reformation and what followed, and deserves more detailed
            examination. It was the discovery of a lost means of culture and
            the consequent awakening and diffusion of a literary, artistic,
            and critical spirit.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A knowledge of
            ancient Latin literature had not entirely perished during the
            earlier Middle Ages. The Benedictine monasteries had preserved
            classical manuscripts—especially the monastery of Monte Cassino
            for the southern, and that of Fulda for the northern parts of
            Europe. These monasteries and their sister establishments were
            schools of learning as well as libraries, and we read of more
            than one where the study of some of the classical authors was
            part of the regular training. Virgil, Horace, Terence and
            Martial, Livy, Suetonius and Sallust, were known and studied.
            Greek literature had not survived to anything like the same
            extent, but it had never entirely disappeared from Southern
            Europe, and especially from Southern Italy. Ever since the days
            of the Roman Republic in that part of the Italian peninsula once
            called Magna Græcia, Greek had been the language of many of the
            common people, as it is to this day, in districts of Calabria and
            of Sicily; and the teachers and students of the mediæval
            University of Salerno had never lost their taste for its
            study.<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> But
            with all this, the fourteenth century, and notably the age of
            Petrarch, saw the beginnings <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> of new zeal for the literature of the past,
            and was really the beginning of a new era.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Italy was the
            first land to become free from the conditions of mediæval life,
            and ready to enter on the new life which was awaiting Europe.
            There was an Italian language, the feeling of distinct
            nationality, a considerable advance in civilisation, an
            accumulation of wealth, and, during the age of the despots, a
            comparative freedom from constant changes in political
            conditions.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dante's great
            poem, interweaving as it does the imagery and mysticism of
            Giacchino di Fiore, the deepest spiritual and moral teaching of
            the mediæval Church, and the insight and judgment on men and
            things of a great poet, was the first sign that Italy had wakened
            from the sleep of the Middle Ages. Petrarch came next, the
            passionate student of the lives, the thoughts, and emotions of
            the great masters of classical Latin literature. They were real
            men for him, his own Italian ancestors, and they as he had felt
            the need of Hellenic culture to solace their souls, and serve for
            the universal education of the human race. Boccaccio, the third
            leader in the awakening, preached the joy of living, the
            universal capacity for pleasure, and the sensuous beauty of the
            world. He too, like Petrarch, felt the need of Hellenic culture.
            For both there was an awakening to the beauty of literary form,
            and the conviction that a study of the ancient classics would
            enable them to achieve it. Both valued the vision of a new
            conception of life derived from the perusal of the classics,
            freer, more enlarged and joyous, more rational than the Middle
            Ages had witnessed. Petrarch and Boccaccio yearned after the life
            thus disclosed, which gave unfettered scope to the play of the
            emotions, to the sense of beauty, and to the manifold activity of
            the human intelligence.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Learned Greeks
            were induced to settle in Italy—men who were able to interpret

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was
            nothing hostile to Christianity or to the mediæval Church in the
            earlier stages of this intellectual revival, and very little of
            the neo-paganism which it developed afterwards. Many of the
            instincts of mediæval piety remained, only the objects were
            changed. Petrarch revered the MS. of Homer, which he could not
            read, as an ancestor of his might have venerated the scapulary of
            a saint.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href=

            men of the early Renaissance made collections of MSS. and
            inscriptions, of cameos and of coins, and worshipped them as if
            they had been relics. The Medicean Library was formed about 1450,
            the Vatican Library in 1453, and the age of passionate collection
            began.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The age of
            scholarship succeeded, and Italian students began to interpret
            the ancient classical authors with a mysticism all their own.
            They sought a means of reconciling Christian thought with ancient
            pagan philosophy, and, like Clement of Alexandria and Origen,
            discovered it in Platonism. Platonic academies were founded, and
            Cardinal Bessarion, Marsiglio Ficino, and Pico della Mirandola
            became the Christian Platonists of Italy. Of course, in their
            enthusiasm they went too far. They appropriated the whole
            intellectual life of a pagan age, and adopted its ethical as well
            as its intellectual perceptions, its basis of sensuous pleasures,
            and its joy in sensuous living. Still their main thought was to
            show that Hellenism as well as Judaism was a pathway to
            Christianity, and that the Sibyl as well as David was a witness
            for Christ.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Papacy
            lent its patronage to the revival of literature <span class=

            "Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and art, and put itself at
            the head of the movement of intellectual life. Pope Nicolas
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">v.</span></span> (1447-1455) was the
            first Bishop of Rome who fostered the Renaissance, and he himself
            may be taken as representing the sincerity, the simplicity, and
            the lofty intellectual and artistic aims of its earliest period.
            Sprung from an obscure family belonging to Saranza, a small town
            near Spezzia, and cast on his own resources before he had fairly
            quitted boyhood, he had risen by his talents and his character to
            the highest position in the Church. He had been private tutor,
            secretary, librarian, and through all a genuine lover of books.
            They were the only personal luxury he indulged in, and perhaps no
            one in his days knew more about them. He was the confidential
            adviser of Lorenzo de Medici when he founded his great library in
            San Marco. He himself began the Vatican Library. He had agents
            who ransacked the monasteries of Europe, and he collected the
            literary relics which had escaped destruction in the sack of
            Constantinople. Before his death his library in the Vatican
            contained more than 5000 MSS. He gathered round him a band of
            illustrious artists and scholars. He filled Rome with skilled and
            artistic artisans, with decorators, jewellers, workers in painted
            glass and embroidery. The famous Leo Alberti was one of his
            architects, and Fra Angelico one of his artists. Laurentius Valla
            and Poggio Bracciolini, Cardinal Bessarion and George of
            Trebizond, were among his scholars. He directed and inspired
            their work. Valla's critical attacks on the Donation of
            Constantine, and on the tradition that the Twelve had dictated
            the Apostles' Creed, did not shake his confidence in the scholar.
            The principal Greek authors were translated into Latin by his
            orders. Europe saw theology, learning, and art lending each other
            mutual support under the leadership of the head of the Church.
            Perhaps Julius <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span> (1503-1513)
            conceived more definitely than even Nicolas had done that one
            duty of the head of the Church was to assume the leadership of
            the intellectual and artistic movement which was making wider the
            thought of Europe,—only his restless energy <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id=

            to give effect to his conception. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
            instruction which Pope Julius <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=

            to represent him as Moses can bear but one interpretation: that
            Julius set himself the mission of leading forth Israel (the
            Church) from its state of degradation, and showing it—though he
            could not grant possession—the Promised Land at least from afar,
            that blessed land which consists in the enjoyment of the highest
            intellectual benefits, and the training and consecration of all
            the faculties of man's mind to union with God.”</span><a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The classical
            revival in Italy soon exhausted itself. Its sensuous perceptions
            degenerated into sensuality, its instinct for the beauty of
            expression into elegant trifling, and its enthusiasm for
            antiquity into neo-paganism. It failed almost from the first in
            real moral earnestness; scarcely saw, and still less understood,
            how to cure the deep-seated moral evils of the age.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Italy had
            given birth to the Renaissance, but it soon spread to the more
            northern lands. Perhaps France first felt the impulse, then
            Germany and England last of all. In dealing with the Reformation,
            the movement in Germany is the most important.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Germans,
            throughout the Middle Ages, had continuous and intimate relations
            with the southern peninsula, and in the fifteenth century these
            were stronger than ever. German merchants had their factories in
            Venice and Genoa; young German nobles destined for a legal or
            diplomatic career studied law at Italian universities; students
            of medicine completed their studies in the famous southern
            schools; and the German wandering student frequently crossed the
            Alps to pick up additional knowledge. There was such constant
            scholarly intercourse between Germany and Italy, that the New
            Learning could not fail to spread among the men of the north.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Germany and
            the Low Countries had been singularly prepared for that revival
            of letters, art, and science which had come to Italy. One of the
            greatest gifts bestowed by the Mystics of the fourteenth and
            fifteenth centuries on their native land had been an excellent
            system of school education. Gerard Groot, a disciple of the
            Flemish mystic Jan van Rysbroeck, had, after long consultations
            with his Master, founded a brotherhood called the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brethren of the
            Common Life</span></span>,<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21"

            whose aim was to better the religious condition of their
            fellow-men by the multiplication of good books and by the careful
            training of the young. They were to support themselves by copying
            and selling manuscripts. All the houses of the Brethren had a
            large room, where a number of scribes sat at tables, a reader
            repeated slowly the words of the manuscript, and books were
            multiplied as rapidly as was possible before the invention of
            printing. They filled their own libraries with the best books of
            Christian and pagan antiquity. They multiplied small tracts
            containing the mystical and practical theology of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Friends
            of God</span></span>, and sent them into circulation among the
            people. One of the intimate followers of Groot, Florentius
            Radewynsohn, proved to be a distinguished educationalist, and the
            schools of the Order soon became famous. The Brethren, to use the
            words of their founder, employed education for the purpose of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“raising spiritual pillars in the Temple
            of the Lord.”</span> They insisted on a study of the Vulgate in
            their classes; they placed German translations of Christian
            authors in the hands of their pupils; they took pains to give
            them a good knowledge of Latin, and read with them selections
            from the best known ancient authors; they even taught a little
            Greek; and their scholars learned to sing the simpler, more
            evangelical Latin hymns.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mother
            school was at Deventer, a town situated at <span class=

            great episcopal territory of Utrecht, now the Dutch province of

            Yessel) which flowing northwards glides past Zutphen, Deventer,
            Zwolle, and loses itself in the Zuyder Zee at Kampen. A large
            number of the more distinguished leaders of the fifteenth century
            owed their early training to this great school at Deventer.
            During the last decades of the fifteenth century the headmaster
            was Alexander Hegius (1433-1498), who came to Deventer in 1471

            (Mutianus Rufus), Hermann von Busch, Johann Murmellius,—and,
            rejecting the older methods of grammatical instruction, taught
            them to know the niceties of the Latin tongue by leading them
            directly to the study of the great writers of classical
            antiquity. He was such an indefatigable student that he kept
            himself awake during the night-watches, it is said, by holding in
            his hands the candle which lighted him, in order to be wakened by
            its fall should slumber overtake him. The glory of Deventer
            perished with this great teacher, who to the last maintained the
            ancient traditions of the school by his maxim, that learning
            without piety was rather a curse than a blessing.</p>

            half-way between Strassburg and Basel; Munster on the Ems, the
            Monasterium of the earlier Middle Ages; Emmerich, a town on the
            Rhine near the borders of Holland, and Altmarck, in the
            north-west. Schlettstadt, under its master Ludwig Dringenberg,
            almost rivalled the fame of Deventer, and many of the members of
            the well-known Strassburg circle which gathered round Jacob
            Wimpheling, Sebastian Brand, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            Keysersberg, had been pupils in this school. Besides these more
            famous establishments, the schools of the Brethren spread all
            over Germany. The teachers were commonly called the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Roll-Brueder</span></span>, and under this
            name they had a school in Magdeburg to which probably Luther was
            sent when he spent a year in that town. Their work was so
            pervading and their teaching so effectual, that we are informed
            by chroniclers, who had nothing to do with the Brethren, that in
            many German towns, girls could be heard singing the simpler Latin
            hymns, and that the children of artisans could converse in
            Latin.</p>

            and Scholarship.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The desire for
            education spread all over Germany in the fifteenth century.
            Princes and burghers vied with each other in erecting seats of
            learning. Within one hundred and fifty years no fewer than
            seventeen new universities were founded. Prag, a Bohemian
            foundation, came into existence in 1348. Then followed four
            German foundations, Vienna, in 1365 or 1384; Heidelberg, in 1386;
            Köln, in 1388; and Erfurt, established by the townspeople, in
            1392. In the fifteenth century there were Leipzig, in 1409;
            Rostock, on the shore of what was called the East Sea, almost
            opposite the south point of Sweden, in 1419; Cracow, a Polish
            foundation, in 1420; Greifswald, in 1456; Freiburg and Trier, in
            1457; Basel, in 1460; Ingolstadt, founded with the special
            intention of training students in obedience to the Pope, a task
            singularly well accomplished, in 1472; Tübingen and Mainz, in
            1477; Wittenberg, in 1502; and Frankfurt-on-the-Oder, in 1507.
            Marburg, the first Reformation University, was founded in
            1527.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The craving
            for education laid hold on the burgher class, and towns vied with
            each other in providing superior schools, with teachers paid out
            of the town's revenues. Some German towns had several such
            foundations. Breslau, <span class="tei tei-q">“the student's
            paradise,”</span> had seven. Nor was <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> the education of girls neglected.
            Frankfurt-on-the-Main founded a high school for girls early in
            the fifteenth century, and insisted that the teachers were to be
            learned ladies who were not nuns.<a id="noteref_24" name=
            "noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>
            Besides the classrooms, the towns usually provided hostels, where
            the boys got lodging and sometimes firewood (they were expected
            to obtain food by begging through the streets of the town), and
            frequently hospitals where the scholars could be tended in
            illness.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href=
            "#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
            possibilities of education attracted boys from all parts of the
            country, and added a new class of vagrants to the tramps of all
            kinds who infested the roads during the later Middle Ages. The
            wandering scholar, with his yellow scarf, was a feature of the
            era, and frequently not a reputable one. He was usually
            introduced as a character into the <span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Fastnachtspiele</span></span>, or rude
            popular carnival comedies, and was almost always a rogue and
            often a thief. Children of ten and twelve years of age left their
            villages, in charge of an older student, to join some famous
            school. But these older students were too often mere vagrants,
            with just learning enough to impose upon the simple peasantry, to
            whom they sold charms against toothache and other troubles. The
            young children entrusted to them by confiding parents were often
            treated with the greatest cruelty, employed by them to beg or
            steal food, and sent round to the public-houses with cans to beg
            for beer. The small unfortunates were the prisoners, the slaves,
            of their disreputable masters, and many of them died by the
            roadside. We need not wonder that Luther, with his memory full of
            these wandering students, in after days denounced the system by
            which men spent sometimes <span class="tei tei-q">“twenty and
            even forty years”</span> in a so-called student life, which was
            often one of the lowest vagrancy and debauchery, and in the end
            knew neither German nor Latin, <span class="tei tei-q">“to say
            nothing,”</span> he adds with honest indignation, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“of the shameful and vicious life by which our worthy
            youth have been so grievously corrupted.”</span> <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id=
            "Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Two or three of the
            autobiographies of these wandering students have survived; and
            two of them, those of Thomas Platter and of Johann Butzbach,
            belong to Luther's time, and give a vivid picture of their
            lives.<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href=
            "#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Germany had no
            lack of schools and universities, but it can scarcely be said
            that they did more than serve as a preparation for the entrance
            of the Renaissance movement. During the fifteenth century all the
            Universities were under the influence of the Church, and
            Scholasticism prescribed the methods of study. Very little of the
            New Learning was allowed to enter. It is true that if Köln and
            perhaps Ingolstadt be excepted, the Scholastic which was taught
            represented what were supposed to be the more advanced
            opinions—those of John Duns Scotus, William of Occam, and Gabriel
            Biel, rather than the learning of Thomas Aquinas and other great
            defenders of papal traditions; but it lent itself as thoroughly
            as did the older Scholastic to the discussion of all kinds of
            verbal and logical subtleties. Knowledge of every kind was
            discussed under formulæ and phrases sanctioned by long scholastic
            use. It is impossible to describe the minute distinctions and the
            intricate reasoning based upon them without exceeding the space
            at our disposal. It is enough to say that the prevailing course
            of study furnished an imposing framework without much solid
            content, and provided an intellectual gymnastic without much real
            knowledge. A survival can be seen in the Formal Logic still
            taught. The quantity of misspent ingenuity called forth to
            produce the figures and moods, and bestowed on discovering and
            arranging all possible moods under each figure and in providing
            all with mnemonic names,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferioque
            prioris</span></span>, etc.,—affords some insight into the
            scholastic methods in use in these universities of the fifteenth
            century.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then it must
            be remembered that the scholarship <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> took a quasi-ecclesiastical form. The
            universities were all monastic institutions, where the teachers
            were professional and the students amateur celibates. The
            scholars were gathered into hostels in which they lived with
            their teachers, and were taught to consider themselves very
            superior persons. The statutes of mediæval Oxford declare that
            God created <span class="tei tei-q">“clerks”</span> with gifts of
            intelligence denied to mere lay persons; that it behoved
            <span class="tei tei-q">“clerks”</span> to exhibit this
            difference by their outward appearance; and that the university
            tailors, whose duty it was to make men <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">extrinsecus</span></span> what God had made
            them <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsecus</span></span>,
            were to be reckoned as members of the University. Those mediæval
            students sometimes assumed airs which roused the passions of the
            laity, and frequently led to tremendous riots. Thus in 1513 the
            townsfolk of Erfurt battered in the gates of the University with
            cannon, and after the flight of the professors and students
            destroyed almost all the archives and library. About the same
            time some citizens of Vienna having jeered at the sacred student
            dress, there ensued the <span class="tei tei-q">“Latin
            war,”</span> which literally devastated the town. This pride of
            separation between <span class="tei tei-q">“clerks”</span> and
            laity culminated in the great annual procession, when the newly
            capped graduates, clothed in all the glory of new bachelors' and
            masters' gowns and hoods, marched through the principal streets
            of the university town, in the midst of the university
            dignitaries and frequently attended by the magistrates in their
            robes. Young Luther confessed that when he first saw the
            procession at Erfurt he thought that no position on earth was
            more enviable than that of a newly capped graduate.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mediæval
            ecclesiastical tradition brooded over all departments of
            learning; and the philosophy and logic, or what were supposed to
            be the philosophy and logic, of Aristotle ruled that tradition.
            The reverence for the name of Aristotle almost took the form of a
            religious fervour. In a curious mediæval <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Life of
            Aristotle</span></span> the ancient pagan thinker is declared to
            be a forerunner of Christ. All who refused to accept his guidance
            were heretics, and his formal scheme of thought was supposed to
            justify the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg
            057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            refined sophisms of mediæval dialectic. His system of thought was
            the fortified defence which preserved the old and protected it
            from the inroads of the New Learning. Hence the hatred which
            almost all the German Humanists seem to have had for the name of
            Aristotle. The attitudes of the partisans of the old and of the
            new towards the ancient Greek thinker are represented in two
            pictures, each instinct with the feeling of the times. In one, in
            the church of the Dominicans in Pisa, Aristotle is represented
            standing on the right with Plato on the left of Thomas Aquinas,
            and rays streaming from their opened books make a halo round the
            head of the great mediæval theologian and thinker. In the other,
            a woodcut published by Hans Holbein the younger in 1527,
            Aristotle with the mediæval doctors is represented descending
            into the abodes of darkness, while Jesus Christ stands in the
            foreground and points out the true light to a crowd of people,
            among whom the artist has figured peasants with their flails.</p>

            Humanists.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
            beginnings of the New Learning made their appearance in Germany,
            they did not bring with them any widespread revival of culture.
            There was no outburst, as in Italy, of the artistic spirit,
            stamping itself upon such arts as painting, sculpture, and
            architecture, which could appeal to the whole public
            intelligence. The men who first felt the stirrings of the new
            intellectual life were, for the most part, students who had been
            trained in the more famous schools of the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brethren of the
            Common Life</span></span>, all of whom had a serious aim in life.
            The New Learning appealed to them not so much a means of
            self-culture as an instrument to reform education, to criticise
            antiquated methods of instruction, and, above all, to effect
            reforms in the Church and to purify the social life. One of the
            most conspicuous of such scholars was Cardinal Nicolas
            Cusanus<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href=
            "#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a>
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name=
            "Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> (1401-1464). He
            was a man of singularly open mind, who, while he was saturated
            with the old learning, was able to appreciate the new. He had
            studied the classics in Italy. He was an expert mathematician and
            astronomer. Some have even asserted that he anticipated the
            discoveries of Galileo. The instruments with which he worked,
            roughly made by a village tinsmith, may still be seen preserved
            in the Brother-house which he founded at his birthplace, Cues, on
            the Mosel; and there, too, the sheets, covered with his long
            calculations for the reform of the calendar, may still be
            studied.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
            scholar, sent out by the same schools, was John Wessel of
            Gröningen (1420-1489), who wandered in search of learning from
            Köln to Paris and from Paris to Italy. He finally settled down as
            a canon in the Brotherhood of Mount St. Agnes. There he gathered
            round him a band of young students, whom he encouraged to study
            Greek and Hebrew. He was a theologian who delighted to criticise
            the current opinions on theological doctrines. He denied that the
            fire of Purgatory could be material fire, and he theorised about
            indulgences in such a way as to be a forerunner of Luther.<a id=

            <span class="tei tei-q">“If I had read his books before,”</span>
            said Luther, <span class="tei tei-q">“my enemies might have
            thought that Luther had borrowed everything from Wessel, so great
            is the agreement between our spirits. I feel my joy and my
            strength increase, I have no doubt that I have taught aright,
            when I find that one who wrote at a different time, in another
            clime, and with a different intention, agrees so entirely in my
            view and expresses it in almost the same words.”</span></p>

            from 1500, and the author of the celebrated <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ship of
            Fools</span></span>, which was translated into many languages,
            and was used by his friend Geiler of Keysersberg as the text for
            one of his courses of popular sermons.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these men,
            and others like-minded and similarly gifted, are commonly
            regarded as the precursors of the German Renaissance, and are
            classed among the German Humanists. Yet it may be questioned
            whether they can be taken as the representatives of that kind of
            Humanism which gathered round Luther in his student days, and of
            which Ulrich von Hutten, the stormy petrel of the times of the
            Reformation, was a notable example. Its beginnings must be traced
            to other and less reputable pioneers. Numbers of young German
            students, with the talent for wandering and for supporting
            themselves by begging possessed by so many of them, had tramped
            down to Italy, where they contrived to exist precariously while
            they attended, with a genuine thirst for learning, the classes
            taught by Italian Humanists. There they became infected with the
            spirit of the Italian Renaissance, and learned also to despise
            the ordinary restraints of moral living. There they imbibed a
            contempt for the Church and for all kinds of theology, and
            acquired the genuine temperament of the later Italian Humanists,
            which could be irreligious without being anti-religious, simply
            because religion of any sort was something foreign to their
            nature.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such a man was
            Peter Luders (1415-1474). He began life as an ecclesiastic,
            wandered down into Italy, where he devoted himself to classical
            studies, and where he acquired the irreligious disposition and
            the disregard for ordinary moral living which disgraced a large
            part of the later Italian Humanists. While living at Padua
            (1444), where he acted as private tutor to some young Germans
            from the Palatinate, he was invited by the Elector to teach Latin
            in the University of Heidelberg. The older professors were
            jealous of him: they insisted on reading and revising his
            introductory lecture: they refused him the use <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id=
            "Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the library; and in
            general made his life a burden. He struggled on till 1460. Then
            he spent many years in wandering from place to place, teaching
            the classics privately to such scholars as he could find. He was
            not a man of reputable life, was greatly given to drink, a free
            liver in every way, and thoroughly irreligious, with a strong
            contempt for all theology. He seems to have contrived when sober
            to keep his heretical opinions to himself, but to have betrayed
            himself occasionally in his drinking bouts. When at Basel he was
            accused of denying the doctrine of Three Persons in the Godhead,
            and told his accusers that he would willingly confess to four if
            they would only let him alone. He ended his days as a teacher of
            medicine in Vienna.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">History has
            preserved the names of several of these wandering scholars who
            sowed the seeds of classical studies in Germany, and there were,
            doubtless, many who have been forgotten. Loose living,
            irreligious, their one gift a genuine desire to know and impart a
            knowledge of the ancient classical literature, careless how they
            fared provided only they could study and teach Latin and Greek,
            they were the disreputable apostles of the New Learning, and in
            their careless way scattered it over the northern lands.</p>

            Cities.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The seed-beds
            of the German Renaissance were at first not so much the
            Universities, as associations of intimates in some of the cities.
            Three were pre-eminent,—Strassburg, Augsburg, and Nürnberg,—all
            wealthy imperial cities, having intimate relations with the
            imperial court on the one hand and with Italy on the other.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Humanist
            circle at Nürnberg was perhaps the most distinguished, and it
            stood in closer relations than any other with the coming
            Reformation. Its best known member was Willibald Pirkheimer<a id=
            "noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>
            (1470-1528), whose training had been more that of a young
            Florentine patrician <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg
            061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            than of the son of a German burgher. His father, a wealthy
            Nürnberg merchant of great intellectual gifts and attainments, a
            skilled diplomatist, and a confidential friend of the Emperor
            Maximilian, superintended his son's education. He took the boy
            with him on the journeys which trade or the diplomatic business
            of his city compelled him to make, and initiated him into the
            mysteries of commerce and of German politics. The lad was also
            trained in the knightly accomplishments of horsemanship and the
            skilful use of weapons. He was sent, like many a young German
            patrician, to Padua and Pavia (1490-1497) to study jurisprudence
            and the science of diplomacy, and was advised not to neglect
            opportunities to acquire the New Learning. When he returned, in
            his twenty-seventh year, he was appointed one of the counsellors
            of the city, and was entrusted with an important share in the
            management of its business. In this capacity it was necessary for
            him to make many a journey to the Diet or to the imperial court,
            and he soon became a favourite with the Emperor Maximilian, who
            rejoiced in converse with a mind as versatile as his own. No
            German so nearly approached the many-sided culture of the leading
            Italian Humanists as did this citizen of Nürnberg. On the other
            hand, he possessed a fund of earnestness which no Italian seems
            to have possessed. He was deeply anxious about reformation in
            Church and State, and after the Leipzig disputation had shown
            that Luther's quarrel with the Pope was no mere monkish dispute,
            but went to the roots of things, he was a sedate supporter of the
            Reformation in its earlier stages. His sisters Charitas and
            Clara, both learned ladies, were nuns in the Convent of St. Clara
            at Nürnberg. The elder, who was the abbess of her convent, has
            left an interesting collection of letters, from which it seems
            probable that she had great influence over her brother, and
            prevented him from joining the Lutheran Church after it had
            finally separated from the Roman obedience.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pirkheimer
            gave the time which was not occupied with public affairs to
            learning and intercourse with scholars. <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> His house was a palace filled with objects
            of art. His library, well stocked with MSS. and books, was open
            to every student who came with an introduction to its owner. At
            his banquets, which were famous, he delighted to assemble round
            his table the most distinguished men of the day. He was quite at
            home in Greek, and made translations from the works of Plato,
            Xenophon, Plutarch, and Lucian into Latin or German. The
            description which he gives, in his familiar letters to his
            sisters and intimate friends, of his life on his brother-in-law's
            country estate is like a picture of the habits of a Roman
            patrician of the fifth century in Gaul. The morning was spent in
            study, in reading Plato or Cicero; and in the afternoon, if the
            gout chanced to keep him indoors, he watched from his windows the
            country people in the fields, or the sportsman and the fisher at
            their occupations. He was fond of entertaining visitors from the
            neighbourhood. Sometimes he gathered round him his upper servants
            or his tenants, with their wives and families. The evening was
            usually devoted to the study of history and archæology, in both
            of which he was greatly interested. He was in the habit of
            sitting up late at night, and when the sky was clear he followed
            the motions of the planets with a telescope; for, like many
            others in that age, he had faith in astrology, and believed that
            he could read future events and the destinies of nations in the
            courses of the wandering stars.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all those
            civic circles, poets and artists were found as members—Hans
            Holbein at Augsburg; Albert Dürer, with Hans Sebaldus Beham, at
            Nürnberg. The contemporary Italian painters, when they ceased to
            select their subjects from Scripture or from the Lives of the
            Saints, turned instinctively to depict scenes from the ancient
            pagan mythology. The German artists strayed elsewhere. They
            turned for subjects to the common life of the people. But the
            change was gradual. The Virgin ceased to be the Queen of Heaven
            and became the purest type of homely human motherhood, and the
            attendant angels, sportive children plucking flowers, fondling
            animals, playing with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg
            063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            fruit. In Lucas Cranach's <span class="tei tei-q">“Rest on the
            Flight to Egypt”</span> two cherubs have climbed a tree to rob a
            bird's nest, and the parent birds are screaming at them from the
            branches. In one of Albert Dürer's representations of the Holy
            Family, the Virgin and Child are seated in the middle of a
            farmyard, surrounded by all kinds of rural accessories. Then
            German art plunged boldly into the delineation of the ordinary
            commonplace life—knights and tournaments, merchant trains, street
            scenes, pictures of peasant life, and especially of peasant
            dances, university and school scenes, pictures of the camp and of
            troops on the march. The coming revolution in religion was
            already proclaiming that all human life, even the most
            commonplace, could be sacred; and contemporary art discovered the
            picturesque in the ordinary life of the people—in the castles of
            the nobles, in the markets of the cities, and in the villages of
            the peasants.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The New
            Learning made its way gradually into the Universities. Classical
            scholars were invited to lecture or settle as private teachers in
            university towns, and the students read Cicero and Virgil, Horace
            and Propertius, Livy and Sallust, Plautus and Terence. One of the
            earliest signs of the growing Humanist feeling appeared in
            changes in one of the favourite diversions of German students. In
            all the mediæval Universities at carnival time the students got
            up and performed plays. The subjects were almost invariably taken
            from the Scriptures or from the Apocrypha. Chaucer says of an

            were either reproductions from Plautus or Terence, or original
            compositions representing the common life of the time.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The legal
            recognition of Humanism within a University <span class=

            Humanists were commonly known as the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Poets.”</span> Freiburg established a chair of
            Poetry in 1471, and Basel in 1474; in Tübingen the stipend for an
            Orator was legally sanctioned in 1481, and Conrad Celtis was
            appointed to a chair of Poetry and Eloquence in 1492.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Erfurt,
            however, was generally regarded as the special nursery of German
            university Humanism ever since Peter Luders had taught there in
            1460. From that date the University never lacked Humanist
            teachers, and a Humanist circle had gradually grown up among the
            successive generations of students. The permanent chief of this
            circle was a German scholar, whose name was Conrad Mut (Mudt,
            Mutta, and Mutti are variations), who Latinised his name into
            Mutianus, and added Rufus because he was red-haired. This
            Mutianus Rufus was in many respects a typical German Humanist. He
            was born in 1472 at Homburg in Hesse, had studied at Deventer
            under Alexander Hegius, had attended the University of Erfurt,
            and had then gone to Italy to study law and the New Learning. He
            became a Doctor of Laws of Bologna, made friends among many of
            the distinguished Italian Humanists, and had gained many patrons
            among the cardinals in Rome. He finally settled in Gotha, where
            he had received a canonry in the Church. He did not win any
            distinction as an author, but has left behind him an interesting
            collection of letters. His great delight was to gather round him
            promising young students belonging to the University of Erfurt,
            to superintend their reading, and to advise them in all literary
            matters. While in Italy he had become acquainted with Pico della
            Mirandola, and had adopted the conception of combining Platonism
            and Christianity in an eclectic mysticism, which was to be the
            esoteric Christianity for thinkers and educated men, while the
            popular Christianity, with its superstitions, was needed for the
            common herd. Christianity, he taught, had its beginnings long
            before the historical advent of our Lord. <span class=

            Scriptures were full of fables, meant, like those of Æsop, to

            opinion about divine things founded on credulity and a persuasion

            believed that to us were given the keys of the kingdom of heaven.

            authority which the Humanists revolted against was merely

            free the common man from his slavish fear of the mediæval
            priesthood; and this made an impassable gulf between their
            aspirations and those of Luther and the real leaders of the

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Similar
            university circles were formed elsewhere: at Basel, where
            Heinrich Loriti from Glarus (Glareanus), and afterwards Erasmus,
            were the attractions; at Tübingen, where Heinrich Bebel, author
            of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As in Italy
            Popes and cardinals patronised the leaders of the Renaissance, so
            in Germany the Emperor and some princes gave their protection to
            Humanism. To German scholars, who were at the head of the new
            movement, Maximilian seemed to be an ideal ruler. His coffers no
            doubt were almost always empty, and he had not lucrative posts at
            his command to bestow upon them; the position of court poet given
            to Conrad Celtes and afterwards to Ulrich von Hutten brought
            little except coronation in presence of the imperial court with a
            tastefully woven laurel crown;<a id="noteref_40" name=

            the character of Maximilian attracted peasantry and scholars
            alike. His romanticism, his abiding youthfulness, his amazing
            intellectual versatility, his knight-errantry, and his sympathy
            fascinated them. Maximilian lives in the folk-song of Germany as
            no other ruler does. The scheme of education sung in the

            Humanists, whether belonging to the learned societies of the
            cities or to the groups in the Universities, were too full of
            individuality to present the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> appearance of a body of men leagued
            together under the impulse of a common aim. The Erfurt band of
            scholars was called <span class="tei tei-q">“the Mutianic
            Host”</span>; but the partisans of the New Learning could
            scarcely be said to form a solid phalanx. Something served,
            however, to bring them all together. This was the persecution of
            Reuchlin.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Johann
            Reuchlin (1455-1522), like Erasmus after him, was very much a man
            by himself. He entered history at first dramatically enough. A
            party of Italian Humanists had met in the house of John
            Argyropoulos in Rome in 1483. Among them was a young unknown
            German, who had newly arrived with letters of introduction to the
            host. He had come, he explained, to study Greek. Argyropoulos
            gave him a Thucydides and asked him to construe a page or two
            into Latin. Reuchlin construed with such ease and elegance, that
            the company exclaimed that Greece had flown across the Alps to
            settle in Germany. The young German spent some years in Italy,
            enjoying the friendship of the foremost Italian scholars. He was
            an ardent student of the New Learning, and on his return was the
            first to make Greek thoroughly popular in Germany. But he was a
            still more ardent student of Hebrew, and it may almost be said of
            him that he introduced that ancient language to the peoples of
            Europe. His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">De Rudimentis Hebraicis</span></span>
            (1506), a grammar and dictionary in one, was the first book of
            its kind. His interest in the language was more than that of a
            student. He believed that Hebrew was not only the most ancient,
            but the holiest of languages. God had spoken in it. He had
            revealed Himself to men not merely in the Hebrew writings of the
            Old Testament, but had also imparted, through angels and other
            divine messengers, a hidden wisdom which has been preserved in
            ancient Hebrew writings outside of the Scriptures,—a wisdom known
            to Adam, to Noah, and to the Patriarchs. He expounded his strange
            mystical theosophy in a curious little book, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Verbo
            Mirifico</span></span> (1494), full of out-of-the-way learning,
            and finding sublime mysteries in the very points of the Hebrew
            Scriptures. Perhaps his central <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> thought is expressed in the sentence,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“God is love; man is hope; the bond
            between them is faith.... God and man may be so combined in an
            indescribable union that the human God and the divine man may be
            considered as one being.”</span><a id="noteref_41" name=

            Baruch, and Capnion (Reuchlin) hold prolonged discourse with each
            other.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Reuchlin was
            fifty-four years of age when a controversy began which gradually
            divided the scholars of Germany into two camps, and banded the
            Humanists into one party fighting in defence of free inquiry.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John
            Pfefferkorn (1469-1522), born a Jew and converted to Christianity
            (1505), animated with the zeal of a convert to bring the Jews
            wholesale to Christianity, and perhaps stimulated by the
            Dominicans of Köln (Cologne), with whom he was closely
            associated, conceived an idea that his former co-religionists
            might be induced to accept Christianity if all their peculiar
            books, the Old Testament excepted, were confiscated. During the
            earlier Middle Ages the Jews had been continually persecuted, and
            their persecution had always been popular; but the fifteenth
            century had been a period of comparative rest for them; they had
            bought the imperial protection, and their services as physicians
            had been gratefully recognised in Frankfurt and many other
            cities.<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href=
            "#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a>
            Still the popular hatred against them as usurers remained, and
            manifested itself in every time of social upheaval. It was always
            easy to arouse the slumbering antipathy.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pfefferkorn
            had written four books against the Jews (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Judenspiegel</span></span>, <span class=

            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Jeudenfeind</span></span>) in the years
            1507-1509, in which he had suggested that the Jews should be
            forbidden to practise usury, that they should be compelled to
            listen to sermons, and that their Hebrew books should be
            confiscated. He actually got a mandate from the Emperor
            Maximilian, probably through some corrupt secretary, empowering
            him to seize upon all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg
            070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            such books. He began his work in the Rhineland, and had already
            confiscated the books of many Jews, when, in the summer of 1509,
            he came to Reuchlin and requested his aid. The scholar not only
            refused, but pointed out some irregularities in the imperial
            mandate. The doubtful legality of the imperial order had also
            attracted the attention of Uriel, the Archbishop of Mainz, who
            forbade his clergy from rendering Pfefferkorn any assistance.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon this
            Pfefferkorn and the Dominicans again applied to the Emperor, got
            a second mandate, then a third, which was the important one. It
            left the matter in the hands of the Archbishop of Mainz, who was
            to collect evidence on the subject of Jewish books. He was to ask
            the opinions of Reuchlin, of Victor von Karben (1422-1515), who
            had been a Jew but was then a Christian priest, of James
            Hochstratten (1460-1527), a Dominican and Inquisitor to the
            diocese of Köln, a strong foe to Humanism, and of the
            Universities of Heidelberg, Erfurt, Köln, and Mainz. They were to
            write out their opinions and send them to Pfefferkorn, who was to
            present them to the Emperor. Reuchlin was accordingly asked by
            the Archbishop to advise the Emperor <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“whether it would be praiseworthy and beneficial to
            our holy religion to destroy such books as the Jews used,
            excepting only the books of the Ten Commandments of Moses, the
            Prophets, and the Psalter of the Old Testament?”</span>
            Reuchlin's answer was ready by November 1510. He went into the
            matter very thoroughly and impartially. He divided the books of
            the Jews into several classes, and gave his opinion on each. It
            was out of the question to destroy the Old Testament. The Talmud
            was a collection of expositions of the Jewish law at various
            periods; no one could express an opinion about it unless he had
            read it through; Reuchlin had only been able to procure portions;
            judging from these, it was likely that the book did contain many
            things contrary to Christianity, but that was the nature of the
            Jewish religion which was protected by law; it did contain many
            good things, and ought not to be destroyed. The Cabala was,
            according to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg
            071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            Reuchlin, a very precious book, which assured us as no other did
            of the divinity of Christ, and ought to be carefully preserved.
            The Jews had various commentaries on the books of the Old
            Testament which were very useful to enable Christian scholars to
            understand them rightly, and they ought not to be destroyed. They
            had also sermons and ceremonial books belonging to their religion
            which had been guaranteed by imperial law. They had books on arts
            and sciences which ought to be destroyed only in so far as they
            taught such forbidden arts as magic. Lastly, there were books of
            poetry and fables, and some of them might contain insults to
            Christ, the Virgin, and the Apostles, and might deserve burning,
            but not without careful and competent examination. He added that
            the best way to deal with the Jews was not to burn their books,
            but to engage in reasonable, gentle, and kindly discussion.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Reuchlin's
            opinion stood alone: all the other authorities suggested the
            burning of Jewish books, and the University of Mainz would not
            exempt the Old Testament until it had been shown that it had not
            been tampered with by Jewish zealots.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The temperate
            and scholarly answer of Reuchlin was made a charge against him.
            The controversy which followed, and which lasted for six weary
            years, was so managed by the Dominicans, that Reuchlin, a
            Humanist and a layman, was made to appear as defying the
            theologians of the Church on a point of theology. Like all
            mediæval controversies, it was conducted with great bitterness
            and no lack of invective, frequently coarse enough. The Humanists
            saw, however, that it was the case of a scholar defending genuine
            scholarship against obscurantists, and, after a fruitless
            endeavour to get Erasmus to lead them, they joined in a common
            attack. Artists also lent their aid. In one contemporary
            engraving, Reuchlin is seated in a car decked with laurels, and
            is in the act of entering his native town of Pforzheim. The Köln
            theologians march in chains before the car; Pfefferkorn lies on
            the ground with an executioner <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            wives in gala costume await the hero, and the town's musicians
            salute him with triumphant melody; while one worthy burgher
            manifests his sympathy by throwing a monk out of a window. The
            other side of the controversy is represented by a rough woodcut,
            in which Pfefferkorn is seen breaking the chair of scholarship in
            which a double-tongued Reuchlin is sitting.<a id="noteref_43"

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
            controversy was raging (1514), Reuchlin had collected a series of
            testimonies to his scholarship, and had published them under the
            title of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Letters from Eminent
            Men</span></span>.<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> This
            suggested to some young Humanist the idea of a collection of
            letters in which the obscurantists could be seen exposing
            themselves and their unutterable folly under the parodied title
            of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum</span></span>.
            The book bears the same relation to the scholastic disputations
            of the later fifteenth century that <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Don
            Quixote</span></span> does to the romances of mediæval chivalry.
            It is a farrago of questions on grammar, etymology, graduation
            precedence, life in a country parsonage, and scholastic
            casuistry. Magister Henricus Schaffsmulius writes from Rome that
            he went one Friday morning to breakfast in the Campo dei Fiori,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name=
            "Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ordered an egg,
            which on being opened contained a chicken. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Quick,”</span> said his companion, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“swallow it, or the landlord will charge the chicken
            in the bill.”</span> He obeyed, forgetting that the day was
            Friday, on which no flesh could be eaten lawfully. In his
            perplexity he consulted one theologian, who told him to keep his
            mind at rest, for an embryo chicken within an egg was like the
            worms or maggots in fruit and cheese, which men can swallow
            without harm to their souls even in Lent. But another, equally
            learned, had informed him that maggots in cheese and worms in
            fruit were to be classed as fish, which everyone could eat
            lawfully on fast days, but that an embryo chicken was quite
            another thing—it was flesh. Would the learned Magister Ortuin,
            who knew everything, decide for him and relieve his burdened
            conscience? The writers send to their dear Magister Ortuin short
            Latin poems of which they are modestly proud. They confess that
            their verses do not scan; but that matters little. The writers of
            secular verse must be attentive to such things; but their poems,
            which relate the lives and deeds of the saints, do not need such
            refinements. The writers confess that at times their lives are
            not what they ought to be; but Solomon and Samson were not
            perfect; and they have too much Christian humility to wish to
            excel such honoured Christian saints. The letters contain a good
            deal of gossip about the wickedness of the poets (Humanists).
            These evil men have been speaking very disrespectfully about the
            Holy Coat at Trier (Treves); they have said that the Blessed
            Relics of the Three Kings at Köln are the bones of three
            Westphalian peasants. The correspondents exchange confidences
            about sermons they dislike. One preacher, who spoke with unseemly
            earnestness, had delivered a plain sermon without any learned
            syllogisms or intricate theological reasoning; he had spoken
            simply about Christ and His salvation, and the strange thing was
            that the people seemed to listen to him eagerly: such preaching
            ought to be forbidden. Allusions to Reuchlin and his trial are
            scattered all through the letters, and the writers reveal
            artlessly their hopes and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> fears about the result. It is possible, one
            laments, that the rascal may get off after all: the writer hears
            that worthy Inquisitor Hochstratten's money is almost exhausted,
            and that he has scarcely enough left for the necessary bribery at
            Rome; it is to be hoped that he will get a further supply. It is
            quite impossible to translate the epistles and retain the
            original flavour of the language,—a mixture of ecclesiastical
            phrases, vernacular idioms and words, and the worst mediæval
            Latin. Of course, the letters contain much that is very
            objectionable: they attack the character of men, and even of
            women; but that was an ordinary feature of the Humanism of the
            times. They were undoubtedly successful in covering the opponents
            of Reuchlin with ridicule, more especially when some of the
            obscurantists failed to see the satire, and looked upon the
            letters as genuine accounts of the views they sympathised with.
            Some of the mendicant friars in England welcomed a book against
            Reuchlin, and a Dominican prior in Brabant bought several copies
            to send to his superiors.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The authorship
            of these famous letters is not thoroughly known; probably several
            Humanist pens were at work. It is generally admitted that they
            came from the Humanist circle at Erfurt, and that the man who
            planned the book and wrote most of the letters was John Jaeger of
            Dornheim (Crotus Rubeanus). They were long ascribed to Ulrich von
            Hutten; some of the letters may have come from his pen—one did
            certainly. These <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            stormy petrel of the Reformation period in Germany, was a member
            of one of the oldest families of the Franconian nobles—a fierce,
            lawless, turbulent nobility. The old hot family blood coursed
            through his veins, and accounts for much in his adventurous
            career. He was the eldest son, but his frail body and sickly
            disposition marked him out in his father's eyes for a clerical
            life. He was sent at the age of eleven to the ancient monastery
            of Fulda, where his precocity in all kinds of intellectual work
            seemed to presage a distinguished position if he remained true to
            the calling to which his father had destined him. The boy,
            however, soon found that he had no vocation for the Church, and
            that, while he was keenly interested in all manner of studies, he
            detested the scholastic theology. He appealed to his father, told
            him how he hated the thought of a clerical life, and asked him to
            be permitted to look forward to the career of a scholar and a man
            of letters. The old Franconian knight was as hard as men of his
            class usually were. He promised Ulrich that he could take as much
            time as he liked to educate himself, but that in the end he was
            to enter the Church. Upon this, Ulrich, an obstinate chip of an
            obstinate block, determined to make his escape from the monastery
            and follow his own life. How he managed it is unknown. He fell in
            with John Jaeger of Dornheim, and the two wandered, German
            student fashion, from University to University; they were at Köln
            together, then at Erfurt. The elder Hutten refused to assist his
            son in any way. How the young student maintained himself no one
            knows. He had wretched health; he was at least twice robbed and
            half-murdered by ruffians as he tramped along the unsafe
            highways; but his indomitable purpose to live the life of a
            literary man or to die sustained him. At last family friends
            patched up a half-hearted reconciliation between father and
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name=
            "Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> son. They pointed
            out that the young man's abilities might find scope in a
            diplomatic career since the Church was so distasteful to him, and
            the father was induced to permit him to go to Italy, provided he
            applied himself to the study of law. Ulrich went gladly to the
            land of the New Learning, reached Pavia, struggled on to Bologna,
            found that he liked law no better than theology, and began to
            write. It is needless to follow his erratic career. He succeeded
            frequently in getting patrons; but he was not the man to live
            comfortably in dependence; he always remembered that he was a
            Franconian noble; he had an irritable temper,—his wretched health
            furnishing a very adequate excuse.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
            that his sojourn in Italy did as much for him as for Luther,
            though in a different way. The Reformer turned with loathing from
            Italian, and especially from Roman wickedness. The Humanist
            meditated on the greatness of the imperial idea, now, he thought,
            the birthright of his Germany, which was being robbed of it by
            the Papacy. Henceforward he was dominated by one persistent
            thought.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was a
            Humanist and a poet, but a man apart, marked out from among his
            fellows, destined to live in the memories of his nation when
            their names had been forgotten. They might be better scholars,
            able to write a finer Latinity, and pen trifles more elegantly;
            but he was a man with a purpose. His erratic and by no means pure
            life was ennobled by his sincere, if limited and unpractical,
            patriotism. He wrought, schemed, fought, flattered, and
            apostrophised to create a united Germany under a reformed
            Emperor. Whatever hindered this was to be attacked with what
            weapons of sarcasm, invective, and scorn were at his command; and
            the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">one</span></em> enemy was the Papacy of the
            close of the fifteenth century, and all that it implied. It was
            the Papacy that drained Germany of gold, that kept the Emperor in
            thraldom, that set one portion of the land against the other,
            that gave the separatist designs of the princes their promise of
            success. The Papacy was his Carthage, which must be
            destroyed.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg
            077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hutten was a
            master of invective, fearless, critically destructive; but he had
            small constructive faculty. It is not easy to discover what he
            meant by a reformation of the Empire—something loomed before him
            vague, grand, a renewal of an imagined past. Germany might be
            great, it is suggested in the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Inspicientes</span></span> (written in
            1520), if the Papacy were defied, if the princes were kept in
            their proper place of subordination, if a great imperial army
            were created and paid out of a common imperial fund,—an army
            where the officers were the knights, and the privates a peasant
            infantry (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">landsknechts</span></span>). It is the
            passion for a German Imperial Unity which we find in all Hutten's
            writings, from the early <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Epistola ad Maximilianum Cæsarem Italiæ
            fictitia</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Vadiscus, or the Roman Triads</span></span>,
            down to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Inspicientes</span></span>—not the means
            whereby this is to be created. He was a born foeman, one who
            loved battle for battle's sake, who could never get enough of
            fighting,—a man with the blood of his Franconian ancestors
            coursing hotly through his veins. Like them, he loved freedom in
            all things—personal, intellectual, and religious. Like them, he
            scorned ease and luxury, and despised the burghers, with their
            love of comfort and wealth. He thought much more highly of the
            robber-knights than of the merchants they plundered. Germany, he
            believed, would come right if the merchants and the priests could
            be got rid of. The robbers were even German patriots who
            intercepted the introduction of foreign merchandise, and
            protected the German producers in securing the profits due to
            them for their labour.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hutten is
            usually classed as an ally of Luther's, and from the date of the
            Leipzig Disputation (1519), when Luther first attacked the Roman
            Primacy, he was an ardent admirer of the Reformer. But he had
            very little sympathy with the deeper religious side of the
            Reformation movement. He regarded Luther's protest against
            Indulgences in very much the same way as did Pope Leo
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">x.</span></span> It was a contemptible
            monkish dispute, and all sensible men, he thought, ought to
            delight to see monks <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg
            078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            devour one another. <span class="tei tei-q">“I lately said to a
            friar, who was telling me about it,”</span> he writes,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Devour one
            another, that ye may be consumed one of another.’</span> It is my
            desire that our enemies (the monks) may live in as much discord
            as possible, and may be always quarrelling among
            themselves.”</span> He attached himself vehemently to Luther (and
            Hutten was always vehement) only when he found that the monk
            stood for freedom of conscience (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Liberty of a

            which have survived, mark his hollow cheeks, high cheek-bones,
            long nose, heavy moustache, shaven chin, whiskers straggling as
            if frayed by the helmet, and bold eyes, we can see the rude
            Franconian noble, who by some strange freak of fortune became a
            scholar, a Humanist, a patriot, and, in his own way, a
            reformer.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
            already said that the times of the Renaissance were a period of
            transition in the social as well as in the intellectual condition
            of the peoples of Europe. The economic changes were so great,
            that no description of the environment of the Reformation would
            be complete without some account of the social revolution which
            was slowly progressing. It must be remembered, however, that
            there is some danger in making the merely general statements
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name=
            "Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> which alone are
            possible in this chapter. The economic forces at work were
            modified and changed in countries and in districts, and during
            decades, by local conditions. Any general description is liable
            to be qualified by numerous exceptions.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Beneath the
            whole mediæval system lay the idea that the land was the only
            economic basis of wealth. During the earlier Middle Ages this was
            largely true everywhere, and was specially so in Germany. Each
            little district produced almost all that it needed for its own
            wants; and the economic value of the town consisted in its being
            a corporation of artisans exchanging the fruits of their
            industries for the surplus of farm produce which the peasants
            brought to their market-place. But the increasing trade of the
            towns, developed at first along the greater rivers, the arteries
            of the countries, gradually produced another source of wealth;
            and this commerce made great strides after the Crusades had
            opened the Eastern markets to European traders. Trade, commerce,
            and manufactures were the life of the towns, and were rapidly
            increasing their importance.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In mediæval
            times each town was an independent economic centre, and the
            regulation of industry and of trade was an exclusively municipal
            affair. This state of matters had changed in some countries
            before the time of the Reformation, and statesmen had begun to
            recognise the importance of a national trade, and to take steps
            to further it; but in Germany, chiefly owing to its hopeless
            divisions, the old state of matters remained, and the
            municipalities continued to direct and control all commercial and
            industrial affairs.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The towns had
            originally grown up under the protection of the Emperor, or of
            some great lord of the soil, or of an ecclesiastical prince or
            foundation, and the early officials were the representatives of
            these fostering powers. The descendants of this early official
            class became known as the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“patricians”</span> of the city, and they regarded
            all the official positions as the hereditary privileges of their
            class. The town population was thoroughly organised in
            associations <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg
            081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            of workmen, commonly called <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“gilds,”</span> which at first concerned themselves
            simply with the regulation and improvement of the industry
            carried on, and with the education and recreations of the
            workers. But these <span class="tei tei-q">“gilds”</span> soon
            assumed a political character. The workmen belonging to them
            formed the fighting force needed for the independence and
            protection of the city. Each <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“gild”</span> had its fighting organisation, its war
            banner, its armoury; and its members were trained to the use of
            arms, and practised it in their hours of recreation. The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“gilds”</span> therefore began to claim
            some share in the government of the town, and in most German
            cities, in the decades before the Reformation, the old
            aristocratic government of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“patricians”</span> had given place to the more
            democratic rule of the <span class="tei tei-q">“gilds.”</span>
            The chief offices connected with the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“gilds”</span> insensibly tended to become hereditary
            in a few leading families, and this created a second <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“patriciat,”</span> whose control was resented by the
            great mass of the workmen. Nürnberg was one of the few great
            German cities where the old <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“patricians”</span> continued to rule down to the
            times of the Reformation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
            <span class="tei tei-q">“gilds”</span> were for the most part
            full of business energy, which showed itself in the twofold way
            of making such regulations as they believed would insure good
            workmanship, and of securing facilities for the sale of their
            wares. All the workmen, it was believed, were interested in the
            production of good articles, and the bad workmanship of one
            artisan was regarded as bringing discredit upon all. Hence, as a
            rule, every article was tested in private before it was exposed
            for public sale, and various punishments were devised to check
            the production of inferior goods. Thus in Bremen every badly made
            pair of shoes was publicly destroyed at the pillory of the town.
            Such regulations belonged to the private administration of the
            towns, and differed in different places. Indeed, the whole
            municipal government of the German cities presents an endless
            variety, due to the local history and other conditions affecting
            the individual towns. While the production was a matter for
            private regulation in each centre of industry, distribution
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name=
            "Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> involved the towns
            in something like a common policy. It demanded safe means of
            communication between one town and another, between the towns and
            the rural districts, and safe outlets to foreign lands. It needed
            roads, bridges, and security of travel. The towns banded
            themselves together, and made alliances with powerful feudal
            nobles to secure these advantages. Such was the origin of the
            great Hanseatic League, which had its beginnings in Flanders,
            spread over North Germany, included the Scandinavian countries,
            and grew to be a European power.<a id="noteref_48" name=
            "noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> The
            less known leagues among the cities of South Germany did equally
            good service, and they commonly secured outlets to Venice,
            Florence, and Genoa, by alliances with the peasantry in whose
            hands were the chief passes of the Alps. All this meant an
            opposition between the burghers and the nobles—an opposition
            which was continuous, which on occasion flamed out into great
            wars, and which compelled the cities to maintain civic armies,
            composed partly of their citizens and partly of hired troops. It
            was reckoned that Strassburg and Augsburg together could send a
            fighting force of 40,000 men into the field.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The area of
            trade, though, according to modern ideas, restricted, was fairly
            extensive. It included all the countries in modern Europe and the
            adjacent seas. The sea-trade was carried on in the Mediterranean
            and Black Seas, in the Baltic and North Seas, and down the
            western coasts of France and Spain. The North Sea was the great
            fishing ground, and large quantities of dried fish, necessary for
            the due keeping of Lent, were despatched in coasting vessels, and
            by the overland routes to the southern countries of Europe. Furs,
            skins, and corn came from Russia and the northern countries.
            Spain, some parts of Germany, and above all England, were the
            wool-exporting countries. The eastern counties of England, many
            towns in Germany and France, and especially the Low Countries,
            were the centres of the woollen manufactures. The north of France
            was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name=
            "Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the great
            flax-growing country. In Italy, at Barcelona in Spain, and at
            Lyons in France, silk was produced and manufactured. The spices
            and dried fruits of the East, and its silks and costly brocades
            and feathers, came from the Levant to Venice, and were carried
            north through the great passes which pierce the range of the
            Alps.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Civic
            statesmen did their best, by mutual bargains and the
            establishment of factories, to protect and extend trading
            facilities for their townsmen. The German merchant had his
            magnificent <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Fondaco dei Tedeschi</span></span> in
            Venice, his factories of the Hanseatic League in London, Bruges,
            Bergen, and even in far-off Novgorod; and Englishmen had also
            their factories in foreign parts, within which they could buy and
            sell in peace.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The perils of
            the German merchant, in spite of all civic leagues, were at home
            rather than abroad. His country swarmed with Free Nobles, each of
            whom looked upon himself as a sovereign power, with full right to
            do as he pleased within his own dominions, whether these were an
            extensive principality or a few hundred acres surrounding his
            castle. He could impose what tolls or customs dues he pleased on
            the merchants whose heavily-laden waggons entered his
            territories. He had customary rights which made bad roads and the
            lack of bridges advantages to the lord of the soil. If an axle or
            wheel broke, if a waggon upset in crossing a dangerous ford, the
            bales thrown on the path or stranded on the banks of the stream
            could be claimed by the proprietor of the land. Worse than all
            were the perils from the robber-knights—men who insisted on their
            right to make private war even when that took the form of highway
            robbery, and who largely subsisted on the gains which came, as
            they said, from making their <span class="tei tei-q">“horses bite
            off the purses of travellers.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite of
            all these hindrances, a capitalist class gradually arose in
            Germany. Large profits, altogether apart from trade, could be
            made by managing, collecting, and forwarding the money coming
            from the universal system of Indulgences. It was in this way that
            the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name=
            "Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Fuggers of
            Augsburg first rose to wealth. Money soon bred money. During the
            greater part of the Middle Ages there was no such thing as
            lending out money on interest, save among the Italian merchants
            of North Italy or among the Jews. The Church had always
            prohibited what it called usury. But Churchmen were the first to
            practise the sin they had condemned. The members of
            ecclesiastical corporations began to make useful advances,
            charging an interest of from 7 to 12 per cent.—moderate enough
            for the times. Gradually the custom spread among the wealthy
            laity, who did not confine themselves to these reasonable
            profits, and we find Sebastian Brand inveighing against the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian Jews,”</span> who had become
            worse oppressors than the Israelite capitalists whom they
            copied.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the great
            alteration in social conditions, following change in the
            distribution of wealth, came when the age of geographical
            discovery had made a world commerce a possible thing.</p>

            the beginning of a World Trade.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fifteenth
            century from its beginning had seen one geographical discovery
            after another. Perhaps we may say that the sailors of Genoa had
            begun the new era by reaching the Azores and Madeira. Then Dom
            Henrique of Portugal, Governor of Ceuta, organised voyages of
            trade and discovery down the coast of Africa. Portuguese,
            Venetian, and Genoese captains commanded his vessels. From 1426,
            expedition after expedition was sent forth, and at his death in
            1460 the coast of Africa as far as Guinea had been explored. His
            work was carried on by his countrymen. The Guinea trade in
            slaves, gold, and ivory was established as early as 1480; the
            Congo was reached in 1484; and Portuguese ships, under
            Bartholomew Diaz, rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1486. During
            these later years a new motive had prompted the voyages of
            exploration. The growth of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Turkish power in the east of Europe had
            destroyed the commercial colonies and factories on the Black Sea;
            the fall of Constantinople had blocked the route along the valley
            of the Danube; and Venice had a monopoly of the trade with Egypt
            and Syria, the only remaining channels by which the merchandise
            from the East reached Europe. The great commercial problem of the
            times was how to get some hold of the direct trade with the East.
            It was this that inspired Bristol skippers, familiar with
            Iceland, with the idea that by following old Norse traditions
            they might find a path by way of the North Atlantic; that sent
            Columbus across the Mid-Atlantic to discover the Bahamas and the
            continent of America; and that drove the more fortunate
            Portuguese round the Cape of Good Hope. Young Vasco da Gama
            reached the goal first, when, after doubling the Cape, he sailed
            up the eastern coast of Africa, reached Mombasa, and then boldly
            crossed the Indian Ocean to Calicut, the Indian emporium for that
            rich trade which all the European nations were anxious to share.
            The possibilities of a world commerce led to the creation of
            trading companies; for a larger capital was needed than
            individual merchants possessed, and the formation of these
            companies overshadowed, discredited, and finally destroyed the
            gild system of the mediæval trading cities. Trade and industry
            became capitalised to a degree previously unknown. One great
            family of capitalists, the Welser, had factories in Rome, Milan,
            Genoa, and Lyons, and tapped the rich Eastern trade by their
            houses in Antwerp, Lisbon, and Madeira. They even tried,
            unsuccessfully, to establish a German colony on the new
            continent—in Venezuela. Another, the Fuggers of Augsburg, were
            interested in all kinds of trade, but especially in the mining
            industry. It is said that the mines of Thuringia, Carinthia, and
            the Tyrol within Germany, and those of Hungary and Spain outside
            it, were almost all in their hands. The capital of the family was
            estimated in 1546 at sixty-three millions of gulden. This
            increase of wealth does not seem to have <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> been confined to a few favourites of
            fortune. It belonged to the mass of the members of the great
            trading companies. Von Bezold instances a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“certain native of Augsburg”</span> whose investment
            of 500 gulden in a merchant company brought him in seven years
            24,500 gulden. Merchant princes confronted the princes of the
            State and those of the Church, and their presence and power
            dislocated the old social relations. The towns, the abodes of
            these rich merchants, acquired a new and powerful influence among
            the complex of national relations, until it is not too much to
            say, that if the political future of Germany was in the hands of
            the secular princes, its social condition came to be dominated by
            the burgher class.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Culture, which
            had long abandoned the cloisters, came to settle in the towns. We
            have already seen that they were the centres of German Humanism
            and of the New Learning. The artists of the German Renaissance
            belonged to the towns, and their principal patrons were the
            wealthy burghers. The rich merchants displayed their civic
            patriotism in aiding to build great churches; in erecting
            magnificent chambers of commerce, where merchandise could be
            stored, with halls for buying and selling, and rooms where the
            merchants of the town could consult about the interests of the
            civic trade; in building <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Artushöfe</span></span> or assembly rooms,
            where the patrician burghers had their public dances, dinners,
            and other kinds of social entertainments; in raising great towers
            for the honour of the town. They built magnificent private
            houses. Æneas Sylvius tells us that in Nürnberg he saw many
            burgher houses that befitted kings, and that the King of Scotland
            was not as nobly housed as a Nürnberg burgher of the second rank.
            They filled these dwellings with gold and silver plate, and with
            costly Venetian glass; their furniture was adorned with delicate
            wood-carving; costly tapestries, paintings, and engravings
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name=

            greatest display. The towns in which all this wealth was
            accumulated were neither populous nor powerful. They cannot be
            compared with the city republics of Italy, where the town ruled
            over a large territory: the lands belonging to the imperial
            cities of Germany were comparatively of small extent. Nor could
            they boast of the population of the great cities of the
            Netherlands. Nürnberg, it is said, had a population of a little
            over 20,000 in the middle of the fifteenth century. Strassburg, a
            somewhat smaller one. The population of Frankfurt-on-the-Main was
            about 10,000 in 1440.<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href=

            number of inhabitants had probably increased by one-half more in
            the decades immediately preceding the Reformation. But all the
            great towns, with their elaborate fortifications, handsome
            buildings, and massive towers, had a very imposing appearance in
            the beginning of the sixteenth century.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was,
            however, another side to all this. There was very little personal
            <span class="tei tei-q">“comfort”</span> and very little personal
            refinement among the rich burghers and nobles of Germany—much
            less than among the corresponding classes in Italy, the
            Netherlands, and France. The towns were badly drained, if drained
            at all; the streets were seldom paved, and mud and filth
            accumulated in almost indescribable ways; the garbage was thrown
            out of the windows; and troops of swine were the ordinary
            scavengers. The increase of wealth showed itself chiefly in all
            kinds of sensual living. Preachers, economists, and satirists
            denounce the luxury and immodesty of the dress both of men and
            women, the gluttony and the drinking habits of the rich burghers
            and of the nobility of Germany. We learn from Hans von
            Schweinichen that noblemen prided themselves on having men among
            their retainers who could drink all rivals <span class=

            "Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> beneath the table, and that
            noble personages seldom met without such a drinking
            contest.<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href=
            "#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> The
            wealthy, learned, and artistic city of Nürnberg possessed a
            public waggon, which every night was led through the streets to
            pick up and convey to their homes drunken burghers found lying in
            the filth of the streets. The <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chronicle of the
            Zimmer Family</span></span> relates that at the castle of Count
            Andrew of Sonnenberg, at the conclusion of a carnival dance and
            after the usual <span class="tei tei-q">“sleeping drink”</span>
            had been served round, one of the company went to the kennels and
            carried to the ball-room buckets of scraps and slops gathered to
            feed the hounds, and that the lords and ladies amused themselves
            by flinging the contents at each other, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“to the great detriment,”</span> the chronicler adds,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“of their clothes and of the
            room.”</span><a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href=

            like licence pervaded the relations between men and women, of
            which it will perhaps suffice to say that the public baths,
            where, be it noted, the bathing was often promiscuous, were such
            that they served Albert Dürer and other contemporary painters the
            purpose of a <span class="tei tei-q">“life school”</span> to make
            drawings of the nude.<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href=

            conversation and behaviour of the nobles and wealthy burghers of
            Germany in the decades before the Reformation displayed a
            coarseness which would now be held to disgrace the lowest classes
            of the population in any country.<a id="noteref_53" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gradual
            capitalising of industry had been sapping the old <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“gild”</span> organisation within the cities; the
            extension of commerce, and especially the shifting of the centre
            of external trade from Venice to Antwerp, in consequence of the
            discovery of the new route to the Eastern markets, and
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name=
            "Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> above all, the
            growth of the great merchant companies, whose world-trade
            required enormous capital, overshadowed the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“gilds”</span> and destroyed their influence. The
            rise and power of this capitalist order severed the poor from the
            rich, and created, in a sense unknown before, a proletariat class
            within the cities, which was liable to be swollen by the influx
            of discontented and ruined peasants from the country districts.
            The corruption of morals, which reached its height in the city
            life of the first quarter of the sixteenth century, intensified
            the growing hatred between the rich burgher and the poor workman.
            The ostentatious display of burgher wealth heightened the natural
            antipathy between merchant and noble. The universal hatred of the
            merchant class is a pronounced feature of the times. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“They increase prices, make hunger, and slay the poor
            folk,”</span> was a common saying. Men like Ulrich von Hutten
            were prepared to justify the robber-knights because they attacked
            the merchants, who, he said, were ruining Germany. Yet the
            merchant class increased and flourished, and with them, the towns
            which they inhabited.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 120%">§ 4. The Condition of the
            Peasantry.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The condition
            of the peasantry in Germany has also to be described. The folk
            who practise husbandry usually form the most stable element in
            any community, but they could not avoid being touched by the
            economic movements of the time. The seeds of revolution had long
            been sown among the German peasantry, and peasant risings had
            taken place in different districts of south-central Europe from
            the middle of the fourteenth down to the opening years of the
            sixteenth centuries. It is difficult to describe accurately the
            state of these German peasants. The social condition of the
            nobles and the burghers has had many an historian, and their
            modes of life have left abundant traces in literature and
            archæology; but peasant houses and implements soon perished, and
            the chronicles seldom refer to the world to which the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name=
            "Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“land-folk”</span> belonged, save when some local
            peasant rising or the tragedy of the Peasants' War thrust them
            into history. Our main difficulty, however, does not arise so
            much from lack of descriptive material—for that can be found when
            diligently sought for—as from the varying, almost contradictory
            statements that are made. Some contemporary writers condescend to
            describe the peasant class. A large number of collections of
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Weisthümer</span></span>,
            the consuetudinary laws which regulated the life of the village
            communities, have been recovered and carefully edited;<a id=
            "noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a>
            folk-songs preserve the old life and usages; many of the
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Fastnachtspiele</span></span>
            or rude carnival dramas deal with peasant scenes; and Albert
            Dürer and other artists of the times have sketched over and over
            again the peasant, his house and cot-yard, his village and his
            daily life. We can, in part, reconstruct the old peasant life and
            its surroundings. Only it must be remembered that the life varied
            not only in different parts of Germany, but in the same districts
            and decades under different rural proprietors; for the peasant
            was so dependent on his over-lord that the character of the
            proprietor counted for much in the condition of the people.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The village
            artisan did not exist. The peasants lived by themselves apart
            from all other classes of the population. That is the universal
            statement. They carried the produce of their land and their
            live-stock to the nearest town, sold it in the market-place, and
            bought there what they needed for their life and work.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They dwelt in
            villages fortified after a fashion; for the group of houses was
            surrounded sometimes by a wall, but usually by a stout fence,
            made with strong stakes and interleaved branches. This was
            entered by a gate that could be locked. Outside the fence,
            circling the whole was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg
            091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            a deep ditch crossed by a <span class="tei tei-q">“falling
            door”</span> or drawbridge. Within the fence among the houses
            there was usually a small church, a public-house, a house or room
            (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Spielhaus</span></span>)
            where the village council met and where justice was dispensed. In
            front stood a strong wooden stake, to which criminals were tied
            for punishment, and near it always the stocks, sometimes a
            gallows, and more rarely the pole and wheel for the barbarous
            mediæval punishment <span class="tei tei-q">“breaking on the
            wheel.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The houses
            were wooden frames filled in with sun-dried bricks, and were
            thatched with straw; the chimneys were of wood protected with
            clay. The cattle, fuel, fodder, and family were sheltered under
            the one large roof. The timber for building and repairs was got
            from the forest under regulations set down in the <span lang="de"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Weisthümer</span></span>, and the peasants
            had leave to collect the fallen branches for firewood, the women
            gathering and carrying, and the men cutting and stacking under
            the eaves. All breaches of the forest laws were severely punished
            (in some of the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Weisthümer</span></span>
            the felling of a tree without leave was punished by beheading);
            so was the moving of landmarks; for wood and soil were
            precious.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most houses
            had a small fenced garden attached, in which were grown cabbages,
            greens, and lettuce; small onions (cibölle, <span lang="de"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Scotticé</span></span> syboes), parsley, and
            peas; poppies, garlic, and hemp; apples, plums, and, in South
            Germany, grapes; as well as other things whose mediæval German
            names are not translatable by me. Wooden beehives were placed in
            the garden, and a pigeon-house usually stood in the yard.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The scanty
            underclothing of the peasants was of wool and the outer dress of
            linen—the men's, girt with a belt from which hung a sword, for
            they always went armed. Their furniture consisted of a table,
            several three-legged stools, and one or two chests. Rude cooking
            utensils hung on the walls, and dried pork, fruits, and baskets
            of grain on the rafters. The drinking-cups were of coarse clay;
            and we find regulations that the table-cloth or covering ought to
            be washed at least once a year! Their ordinary <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id=
            "Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> food was <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“some poor bread, oatmeal porridge, and cooked
            vegetables; and their drink, water and whey.”</span> The
            live-stock included horses, cows, goats, sheep, pigs, and
            hens.<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href=
            "#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The villagers
            elected from among themselves four men, the <span lang="de"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bauernmeister</span></span>, who were the
            Fathers of the community. They were the arbiters in disputes,
            settled quarrels, and arranged for an equitable distribution of
            the various feudal assessments and services. They had no judicial
            or administrative powers; these belonged to the over-lord, or a
            representative appointed by him. This official sat in the justice
            room, heard cases, issued sentences, and exercised all the
            mediæval powers of <span class="tei tei-q">“pit and
            gallows.”</span> The whole list of mediæval punishments,
            ludicrous and gruesome, were at his command. It was he who
            ordered the scolding wife to be carried round the church three
            times while her neighbours jeered; who set the unfortunate
            charcoal-burner, who had transgressed some forest law, into the
            stocks, with his bare feet exposed to a slow fire till his soles
            were thoroughly burnt; who beheaded men who cut down trees, and
            ordered murderers to be broken on the wheel. He saw that the
            rents, paid in kind, were duly gathered. He directed the forced
            services of ploughing, sowing, and harvesting the over-lord's
            fields, what wood was to be hewn for the castle, what ditches
            dug, and what roads repaired. He saw that the peasants drank no
            wine <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg
            093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            but what came from the proprietor's vineyards, and that they
            drank it in sufficient quantity; that they ground their grain at
            the proprietor's mill, and fired their bread at the estate
            bakehouse. He exacted the two most valuable of the moveable goods
            of a dead peasant—the hated <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“death-tax.”</span> There was no end to his powers.
            Of course, according to the <span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Weisthümer</span></span>, these powers were
            to be exercised in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">customary</span></em> ways; and in some
            parts of Germany the indefinite <span class="tei tei-q">“forced
            services”</span> had been commuted to twelve days' service in the
            year, and in others to the payment of a fixed rate in lieu of
            service.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
            description of the peasant life has been taken entirely from the
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Weisthümer</span></span>,
            and, for reasons to be seen immediately, it perhaps represents
            rather a <span class="tei tei-q">“golden past”</span> than the
            actual state of matters at the beginning of the sixteenth
            century. It shows the peasants living in a state of rude plenty,
            but for the endless exactions of their lords and the continual
            robberies to which they were exposed from bands of sturdy rogues
            which swarmed through the country, and from companies of
            soldiers, who thought nothing of carrying off the peasant's cows,
            slaying his swine, maltreating his womenkind, and even firing his
            house.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The peasants
            had their diversions, not always too seemly. On the days of
            Church festivals, and they were numerous, the peasantry went to
            church and heard Mass in the morning, talked over the village
            business under the lime-trees, or in some open space near the
            village, and spent the afternoon in such amusements as they liked
            best—eating and drinking at the public-house, and dancing on the
            village green. In one of his least known poems, Hans Sachs
            describes the scene—the girls and the pipers waiting at the
            dancing-place, and the men and lads in the public-house eating
            calf's head, tripe, liver, black puddings, and roast pork, and
            drinking whey and the sour country wine, until some sank under
            the benches; and there was such a jostling, scratching, shoving,
            bawling, and singing, that not a word could be heard. Then three
            young men came to the dancing-place, his sweetheart had a garland
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The winter
            amusements gathered round the spinning house. For it was the
            custom in most German villages for the young women to resort to a
            large room in the mill, or to the village tavern, or to a
            neighbour's house, with their wool and flax, their distaffs and
            spindles, some of them old heirlooms and richly ornamented, to
            spin all evening. The lads came also to pick the fluff off the
            lasses' dresses, they said; to hold the small beaker of water
            into which they dipped their fingers as they span; and to cheer
            the spinsters with songs and recitations. After work came the
            dancing. On festival evenings, and especially at carnival times,
            the lads treated their sweethearts to a late supper and a dance;
            and escorted them home, carrying their distaffs and
            spindles.<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href=

            the old German love folk-songs are full of allusions to this
            peasant courtship, and it is not too much to say that from the
            singing in the spinning house have come most of the oldest
            folk-songs.</p>

            descriptions apply to the German peasants of Central and South
            Germany. In the north and north-east, the agricultural
            population, which was for the most part of Slavonic descent, had
            been reduced by their conquerors to a serfdom which had no
            parallel in the more favoured districts.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 120%">§ 5. Earlier Social
            Revolts.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was among
            the peasants of German descent that there had been risings,
            successful and unsuccessful, for more than a century. The train
            for revolution had been laid not where serfdom was at its worst,
            but where there was ease enough in life to allow men to think,
            and where freedom was nearest in sight. It may be well to refer
            to the earlier peasant revolts, before attempting to investigate
            the causes of that permanent unrest which was abundantly evident
            at the beginning of the sixteenth century.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
            great successful peasant rebellion was the fight for freedom made
            by the people of the four forest cantons in Switzerland. The
            weapons with which they overthrew the chivalry of Europe, rude
            pikes made by tying their scythes to their alpenstocks, may still
            be seen in the historical museums of Basel and Constance. They
            proved that man for man the peasant was as good as the noble. The
            free peasant soldier had come into being. These free peasants did
            not really secede from the Empire till 1499, and were formally
            connected with it till 1648. The Emperor was still their
            over-lord. But they were his free peasants, able to form leagues
            for their mutual defence and for the protection of their rights.
            Other cantons and some neighbouring cities joined them, and the
            Swiss Confederacy, with its flag, a white cross on a red ground,
            and its motto, <span class="tei tei-q">“Each for all and all for
            each,”</span> became a new nation in Europe. During the next
            century (1424-1471) the peasants of the Rhætian Alps also won
            their freedom, and formed a confederacy similar to the Swiss,
            though separate from it. It was called the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Graubund</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The example of
            these peasant republics, strong in the protection which their
            mountains gave them, fired the imagination of the German
            peasantry of the south and the south-west of the Empire, and the
            leaders of lost popular causes found a refuge in the Alpine
            valleys while they meditated on fresh schemes to emancipate their
            followers. We have evidence of the popularity of the Swiss in the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name=
            "Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> towns and country
            districts of Germany all through the fifteenth and into the
            sixteenth century.<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href=
            "#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while the
            social tumults and popular uprisings against authority, which are
            a feature of the close of the Middle Ages, are usually and
            rightly enough called peasant insurrections, the name tends to
            obscure their real character. They were rather the revolts of the
            poor against the rich, of debtors against creditors, of men who
            had scanty legal rights or none at all against those who had the
            protection of the existing laws, and they were joined by the poor
            of the towns as well as by the peasantry of the country
            districts. The peasants generally began the revolt and the
            townsmen followed; but this was not always the case. Sometimes
            the mob of the cities rose first and the peasants joined
            afterwards. In many cases, too, the poorer nobles were in secret
            or open sympathy with the insurrectionary movement. On more than
            one occasion they led the insurgents and fought at their head.
            The union of poor nobles and peasants had made the Bohemian
            revolt successful.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must also
            be remembered that from the end of the fourteenth century on to
            the beginning of the sixteenth, however varied the cries and
            watchwords of the insurgents may be, one persistent note of
            detestation of the priests (the <span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">pfaffen</span></span>) is always heard; and,
            from the way in which Jews and priests are continually linked
            together in one common denunciation, it may be inferred that the
            hatred arose more from the intolerable pressure of clerical
            extortion than from any feeling of irreligion. The tithes, great
            and small, and the means taken to exact them, were a galling
            burden. <span class="tei tei-q">“The priests,”</span> says an
            English writer, <span class="tei tei-q">“have their tenth part of
            all the corn, meadows, pasture, grass, wood, colts, lambs, geese,
            and chickens. Over and besides the tenth part of every servant's
            wages, wool, milk, honey, wax, cheese, and butter; yea, and they
            look so narrowly after their profits that the poor wife must be
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name=
            "Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> countable to them
            for every tenth egg, or else she getteth not her rights at
            Easter, and shall be taken as a heretic.”</span> As matter of
            fact, many of these tithes, extorted in the name of the Church,
            did not go into the pockets of the clergy at all, but were seized
            by the feudal superior and went to increase his revenues. Popular
            feeling, however, seldom discriminates, and feudal and clerical
            dues were regarded as belonging to one system of intolerable
            oppression. Besides, the rapacity of Churchmen went far beyond
            the exaction of the tithes. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
            see,”</span> said a Spaniard, <span class="tei tei-q">“that we
            can scarcely get anything from Christ's ministers but for money;
            at baptism money, at bishoping money, at marriage money, for
            confession money—no, not extreme unction without money! They will
            ring no bells without money, no burial in the church without
            money; so that it seemeth that Paradise is shut up from them that
            have no money. The rich is buried in the church, the poor in the
            churchyard. The rich man may marry with his nearest kin, but the
            poor not so, albeit he be ready to die for love of her. The rich
            may eat flesh in Lent, but the poor may not, albeit fish perhaps
            be much dearer. The rich man may readily get large Indulgences,
            but the poor none, because he wanteth money to pay for
            them.”</span><a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href=
            "#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite of
            this hatred of the priests, it will be found that almost every
            insurrectionary movement was impregnated by some sentiment of
            enthusiastic religion, with which was blended some confused dream
            that the kingdom of God might be set up on earth, if only the
            priests were driven out of the land. This religious element drew
            some of its strength from the Lollard movement in England and
            from the Taborite in Bohemia, but after 1476 it had a distinctly
            German character. Its connection with what may almost be called
            the epidemic of pilgrimages, the strongly increased veneration
            for the Blessed Virgin, and the injunctions laid upon the
            confederates in some of the revolutionary movements to repeat so
            many <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Pater Nosters</span></span> <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id=

            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ave
            Marias</span></span>, seem to lead to the conclusion that much of
            that revival of an enthusiastic and superstitious religion which
            marked the last half of the fifteenth century may be regarded as
            an attempt to create a popular religion apart from priests and
            clergy of all kinds.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the
            earliest of these popular uprisings occurred at Gotha in 1391,
            when the peasantry of the neighbourhood and many of the burghers
            of the town rose against the exactions of the Jews, and demanded
            their expulsion. It was an insurrection of debtors against
            usurers, and was in the end put down by the majority of the
            citizens. From this date onwards to 1470 similar risings took
            place in many parts of Germany, prompted by the same or like
            causes—the exactions of Jews, priests, or nobles. The years
            1431-1432 saw a great Hussite propaganda carried on all over
            Europe. Countries were flooded with Hussite proclamations, and
            traversed by Hussite emissaries. Paul Crawar was sent to
            Scotland, and others like him to Spain, to the Netherlands, and
            to East Prussia. They taught among other things that the Old
            Testament law about tithes had no place within the Christian
            Church, and that Christian tithes were originally free-will
            offerings,—a statement peculiarly acceptable to the German
            peasantry. All Germany had learnt by this time how Bohemian
            peasants, trained and led by men belonging to the lesser
            nobility, had routed in two memorable campaigns the imperial
            armies led by the Emperor himself, and how they had begun even to
            invade Germany. The chroniclers speak of the anxiety of the
            governing classes, civic and rural, when they recognised the
            strength of the feelings excited by this propaganda. The Hussite
            doctrine of tithes appears hereafter in most of the peasant
            programmes.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A still more
            powerful impulse to revolts was given by the tragic fate of
            Charles the Bold of Burgundy. Charles was the ideal feudal
            autocrat. He was looked up to and imitated by the feudal princes
            of Germany in the fifteenth as was Louis <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">xiv.</span></span> by their
            descendants in the end of the seventeenth century. The common
            people regarded him as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg

            the typical feudal tyrant, and the hateful impression which his
            arrogance, his vindictiveness, and his oppression of the poor
            made upon them comes out in the folk-songs of the period:</p>

            arose in the very centre of Germany, within the district which

            towns of Aschaffenburg, Würzburg, and Crailsheim, in the secluded
            valleys of the Spessart and the Taubergrund. A young man, Hans
            Böhm (Böheim, Böhaim), belonging to the very lowest class of
            society, below the peasant, who wandered from one country
            festival or church ale to another, and played on the small drum
            or on the dudelsack (rude bagpipes), or <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class=

            awakened to a sense of spiritual things by the discourse of a
            wandering Franciscan. He was utterly uneducated. He did not even
            know the Creed. He had visions of the Blessed Virgin, who
            appeared to him in the guise of a lady dressed in white, called
            him to be a preacher, and promised him further revelations, which
            he received from time to time. His home was the village of
            Helmstadt in the Tauber valley; and the most sacred spot he knew
            was a chapel dedicated to the Virgin at the small village of
            Niklashausen on the Tauber. The chapel had been granted an
            indulgence, and was the scene of small pilgrimages. Hans Böhm
            appeared suddenly on the Sunday in Mid-Lent (March 24th, 1476),
            solemnly burnt his rude drum and bagpipes before the crowd of
            people, and declared that he had hitherto ministered to the sins
            and vanities of the villagers, but that henceforth he was going
            to be a preacher of grace. He had been a lad of blameless life,
            and his character gave force to his words. He related his
            visions, and the people believed him. It was a period when an
            epidemic of pilgrimage was sweeping over Europe, and the pilgrims
            spread the news of the prophet far and wide. Crowds came to hear
            him from the neighbouring valleys. His fame spread to more
            distant parts, and chroniclers declare that on some days he
            preached to audiences of from twenty to thirty thousand persons.
            His pulpit was a barrel set on end, or the window of a farmhouse,
            or the branch of a tree. He assured his hearers that the holiest
            spot on earth, holier by far than Rome, was the chapel of Our
            Lady at Niklashausen, and that true religion consisted in doing
            honour to the Blessed Virgin. He denounced all priests in
            unmeasured terms: they were worse than Jews; they might be
            converted for a while, but as soon as they went back among their
            fellows they were sure to become backsliders. He railed against
            the Emperor: he was a miscreant, who supported the whole vile
            crew of princes, over-lords, tax-gatherers, and other oppressors
            of the poor. He scoffed at the Pope. He denied the existence of
            Purgatory: good <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg
            101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            men went directly to heaven and bad men went to hell. The day was
            coming, he declared, when every prince, even the Emperor himself,
            must work for his day's wages like all poor people. He asserted
            that taxes of all kinds were evil, and should not be paid; that
            fish, game, and meadow lands were common property; that all men
            were brethren, and should share alike. When his sermon was
            finished the crowd of devotees knelt round the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“holy youth,”</span> and he, blessing them, pardoned
            their sins in God's name. Then the crowd surged round him,
            tearing at his clothes to get some scrap of cloth to take home
            and worship as a relic; and the Niklashausen chapel became rich
            with the offerings of the thousands of pilgrims.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            authorities, lay and clerical, paid little attention to him at
            first. Some princes and some cities (Nürnberg, for example)
            prohibited their subjects from going to Niklashausen; but the
            prophet was left untouched. He came to believe that his words
            ought to be translated into actions. One Sunday he asked his
            followers to meet him on the next Sunday, bringing their swords
            and leaving their wives and children at home. The Bishop of
            Würzburg, hearing this, sent a troop of thirty-four horsemen, who
            seized the prophet, flung him on a horse, and carried him away to
            the bishop's fortress of Frauenberg near Würzburg. His followers
            had permitted his capture, and seemed dazed by it. In a day or
            two they recovered their courage, and, exhorted by an old peasant
            who had received a vision, and headed by four Franconian knights,
            they marched against Frauenberg and surrounded it. They expected
            its walls to fall like those of Jericho; and when they were
            disappointed they lingered for some days, and then gradually
            dispersed. Hans himself, after examination, was condemned to be
            burnt as a heretic. He died singing a folk-hymn in praise of the
            Blessed Virgin.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His death did
            not end the faith of his followers. In spite of severe
            prohibitions, the pilgrimages went on and the gifts accumulated.
            A neighbouring knight sacked the chapel and carried away the
            treasure, which he was forced <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> to share with his neighbours. Still the
            pilgrimages continued, until at last the ecclesiastical
            authorities removed the priest and tore down the building, hoping
            thereby to destroy the movement.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The memory of
            Hans Böhm lived among the common people, peasants and artisans;
            for the lower classes of Würzburg and the neighbouring towns had
            been followers of the movement. A religious social movement,
            purely German, had come into being, and was not destined to die
            soon. The effects of Hans Böhm's teaching appear in almost all
            subsequent peasant and artisan revolts.<a id="noteref_60" name=

            Sebastian Brand takes the Niklashausen pilgrims as his type of
            those enthusiasts who are not contented with the revelations of

            their own:</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this time
            onwards there was always some tinge of religious enthusiasm in
            the social revolts, where peasant and poor burghers stood
            shoulder to shoulder against the ruling powers in country and in
            town.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The peasants
            within the lands of the Abbot of Kempten, north-east of the Lake
            of Constance, had for two generations protested against the way
            in which the authorities <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> were treating them (1420-1490). They rose
            in open revolt in 1491-1492. It was a purely agrarian rising to
            begin with, caused by demands made on them by their over-lord not
            sanctioned by the old customs expressed in the <span lang="de"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Weisthümer</span></span>; but the lower
            classes of the town of Kempten made common cause with the
            insurgents. Yet there are distinct traces of impregnation with
            religious enthusiasm not unlike that which inspired the Hans Böhm
            movement. The rising was crushed, and the leaders who escaped
            took refuge in Switzerland.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            widespread social revolt which broke out in Elsass in 1493, the
            peasants were supported by the towns; demands were made for the
            abolition of the imperial and the ecclesiastical courts of
            justice, for the reduction of ecclesiastical property, for the
            plundering of Jews who had been fattening upon usury, and for the
            curbing of the power of the priests. The Germans had a proverb,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The poor man must tie his shoes with
            string,”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“tied
            shoe”</span> (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Bundschuh</span></span>),
            the poor man's shoe, became the emblem of this and subsequent
            social revolts, while their motto was, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Only what is just before God.”</span> This
            rebellion, which was prematurely betrayed, did not lack prominent
            leaders. One of them was Hans Ulman, the burgomeister of
            Schlettstadt, who died on the scaffold affirming the justice of
            the demands which he and his companions had made, and predicting
            their future triumph.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1501 the
            peasants of Kempten and the neighbouring districts again rose in
            rebellion, and were again joined by the poorer townspeople. In
            the year following, 1502, a revolt was planned having for its
            headquarters the village of Untergrombach, near Speyer; it spread
            into Elsass, along the Neckar and down the Rhine. The <span lang=
            "de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bundschuh</span></span> banner was again
            unfurled. It was made of blue silk, with a white cross, the
            emblem of Switzerland, in the centre. It was adorned with a
            picture of the crucified Christ, a <span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bundschuh</span></span> <span class=

            "Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> on the one side, and a
            kneeling peasant on the other. The motto was again, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Only what is just before God.”</span> Every
            associate promised to repeat five times a day the Lord's Prayer
            and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Ave Maria</span></span>. The patron saints
            were declared to be the Blessed Virgin and St. John. The movement
            was strongly anti-clerical. The leaders taught that there could
            be no deliverance from oppression until the priests were driven
            from the land, and until the property of the nobles and the
            priests was confiscated and their power broken. Tithes, feudal
            exactions of all kinds, and all social inequalities were
            denounced; water, forest and pasture lands were declared to be
            the common property of all. The leaders recognised the rule of
            the Emperor as over-lord, but denounced all intermediate
            jurisdictions. The plan was to raise the peasants and the
            townspeople throughout all Germany, and to call upon the Swiss to
            aid them in winning their deliverance from oppression. The revolt
            was put down with savage cruelty; most of the leaders were
            quartered. Many escaped to Switzerland, and lay hid among the
            Alpine valleys.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of these
            was Joss Fritz, who had been a soldier (<span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">landsknecht</span></span>)—a man with many
            qualities of leadership. He had tenacity of purpose, great powers
            of organisation, and gifts of persuasion. He vowed to restore the
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Bundschuh</span></span>
            League. He remained years in hiding in Switzerland, maturing his
            plans. Then he returned secretly to his own people. He seems to
            have secured an appointment as forester to a nobleman whose lands
            lay near the town of Freiburg in the Breisgau; and there, in the
            small village of Lehen, he began to weave together again the
            broken threads of the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bundschuh</span></span> League. He mingled
            with the poorer people in the taverns, at church ales, on the
            village greens on festival days. He spoke of the justice of God
            and the wickedness of the world. He expounded the old principles
            of the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Bundschuh</span></span>
            with some few variations. Indiscriminate hatred of priests seems
            to have been abandoned. Most of the village priests were
            peasants, and suffered, like them, from overbearing superiors.
            The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name=
            "Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> parish priest of
            Lehen became a strong supporter of the <span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bundschuh</span></span>, and told his
            parishioners that all its ideas could be proved from the word of
            God. Joss Fritz won over to his side the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“gilds”</span> of beggars, strolling musicians, all
            kinds of vagrants who could be useful. They carried his messages,
            summoned the people to his meetings in quiet spaces in the woods,
            and were active assistants. At these meetings Joss Fritz and his
            lieutenant Jerome, a journeyman baker, expounded the Scriptures
            <span class="tei tei-q">“under the guidance of the Holy Spirit
            simply,”</span> and proved all the demands of the <span lang="de"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bundschuh</span></span> from the word of
            God.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
            country seemed almost ripe for the rising, Joss Fritz resolved to
            prepare the banner as secretly as possible. It was easy to get
            the blue silk and sew the white cross on its ground; the
            difficulty was to find an artist sympathetic enough to paint the
            emblems, and courageous enough to keep the secret. The banner was
            at last painted. The crucified Christ in the centre, a peasant
            kneeling in prayer on the one side and the <span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bundschuh</span></span> on the other, the
            figures of the Virgin Mary and St. John, and the pictures of the
            Pope and the Emperor. The motto, <span class="tei tei-q">“O Lord,
            help the righteous,”</span> was added, and the banner with its
            striking symbolism was complete. The League had the old programme
            with some alterations:—no masters but God, the Pope, and the
            Emperor, no usury, all debts to be cancelled, and the clauses
            mentioned above. The leaders boasted that their league extended
            as far as the city of Köln (Cologne), and that the Swiss would
            march at their head. But the secret leaked out before the date
            planned for the general rising; and the revolt was mercilessly
            stamped out (1512-1513). Its leader escaped with the <span lang=
            "de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bundschuh</span></span> banner wound round
            his body under his clothes. In four years he was back again at
            his work (1517). In a very short time his agents, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“gild”</span> of beggars, wandering
            minstrels, poor priests, pilgrims to local shrines,
            pardon-sellers, begging friars, and even lepers, had leagued the
            peasantry and the poorer artisans in the towns in one vast
            conspiracy which permeated the entire district <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id=
            "Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> between the Vosges and the
            Black Forest, including the whole of Baden and Elsass. The plot
            was again betrayed before the plans of the leaders were matured,
            and the partial risings were easily put down; but when the
            authorities set themselves to make careful investigations, they
            were aghast at the extent of the movement. The peasants of the
            country districts and the populace of the towns had been bound
            together to avenge common wrongs. The means of secret
            communication had been furnished by country innkeepers, old
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">landsknechts</span></span>,
            pedlars, parish priests, as well as by the vagrants above
            mentioned; and the names of some of the subordinate
            leaders—<span class="tei tei-q">“long”</span> John, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“crooked”</span> Peter, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“old”</span> Kuntz—show the classes from which they
            were drawn. It was discovered that the populace of Weisenburg had
            come to an agreement with the people of Hagenau (both towns were
            in Elsass) to slay the civic councillors and judges and all the
            inhabitants of noble descent, to refuse payment of all imperial
            and ecclesiastical dues, and that the Swiss had promised to come
            to their assistance.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One might
            almost say that between the years 1503 and 1517 the social
            revolution was permanently established in the southern districts
            of the Empire, from Elsass in the west to Carinthia and the
            Steiermarck in the east. It is needless to describe the risings
            in detail. They were not purely peasant rebellions, for the
            townspeople were almost always involved; but they all displayed
            that mingling of communist ideas and religious enthusiasm of
            which the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Bundschuh</span></span>
            banner had become the emblem, and which may be traced back to the
            movement under Hans Böhm as its German source, and perhaps to the
            earlier propaganda of the Hussite revolutionaries or Taborites.
            The later decades of the fifteenth and the earlier years of the
            sixteenth century were a time of permanent social unrest.</p>

            been such a very hard one, were so ready to rise in rebellion
            during the last quarter of the fifteenth century, the answer
            seems to be that there must have been a growing change in their
            circumstances. Some chroniclers have described the condition of
            the peasants in the end of the fifteenth and in the beginning of
            the sixteenth century, and they always dwell upon their misery.
            John Böhm, who wrote in the beginning of the sixteenth century,
            says that <span class="tei tei-q">“their lot was hard and
            pitiable,”</span> and calls them <span class=

            Sebastian Frank (1534), Sebastian Munster (1546), H. Pantaleone
            (1570), an Italian who wrote a description of Germany, all agree
            with Böhm. Frank adds that the peasants hate every kind of
            cleric, good or bad, and that their speech is full of gibes
            against priests and monks; while Pantaleone observes that many
            skilled workmen, artisans, artists, and men of learning have
            sprung from this despised peasant class. There must have been a
            great change for the worse in the condition of the poorer
            dwellers both in town and in country.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far as the
            townsmen are concerned, nothing need be added to what has already
            been said; but the causes of the growing depression of the
            peasantry were more complicated. The universal testimony of
            contemporaries is that the gradual introduction of Roman law
            brought the greatest change, by placing a means of universal
            oppression in the hands of the over-lords. There is no need to
            suppose that the lawyers who introduced the new jurisprudence
            meant to use it to degrade and oppress the peasant class. A
            slight study of the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Weisthümer</span></span> shows how
            complicated and varied was this consuetudinary law which
            regulated the relations between peasant and over-lord. It was
            natural, when great estates grew to be principalities, whether
            lay or clerical, that the over-lords should seek for some
            principle of codification or reduction to uniformity. It had been
            the custom for centuries to attempt to simplify the ruder and
            involved German codes by bringing them into harmony with the
            principles of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg
            108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            Roman law, and this idea had received a powerful impetus from the
            Renaissance movement. But when the bewildering multiplicity of
            customary usages which had governed the relations of cultivators
            to over-lords was simplified according to the ideas of Roman law,
            the result was in the highest degree dangerous to the free
            peasantry of Germany. The conception of strict individual
            proprietorship tended to displace the indefinite conception of
            communal proprietorship, and the peasants could only appear in
            the guise of tenants on long leases, or serfs who might have some
            personal rights but no rights of property, or slaves who had no
            rights at all. The new jurisprudence began by attacking the
            common lands, pastures, and forests. The passion for the chase,
            which became the more engrossing as the right to wage private war
            grew more and more dangerous, led to the nobles insisting on the
            individual title to all forest lands, and to the publication of
            such forest laws as we find made in Würtemberg, where anyone
            found trespassing with gun or cross-bow was liable to lose one
            eye. The attempt to reduce a free peasantry in possession of
            communal property to tenants on long lease, then to serfs, and,
            lastly, to slaves, may be seen in the seventy years' struggle
            between the Abbots of Kempten and their peasants. These spiritual
            lords carried on the contest with every kind of force and
            chicanery they could command. They enlarged illegally the
            jurisdiction of their spiritual courts; they prevented the poor
            people who opposed them from coming to the Lord's Table; they
            actually falsified their title-deeds, inserting provisions which
            were not originally contained in them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The case of
            the Kempten lands was, no doubt, an extreme one, though it could
            be matched by others. But the point to be noticed is the immense
            opportunities for oppression which were placed in the hands of
            the over-lords by the new jurisprudence, and the temptation to
            make use of them when their interests seemed to require it, or
            when their peasantry began to grow refractory or became too
            prosperous. The economic changes which were at <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id=
            "Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> work throughout the fifteenth
            century gave occasion for the use of the powers which the new
            jurisdiction had placed at the disposal of landlords. The
            economic revolution from the first impoverished the nobles of
            Germany; while, in its beginnings and until after the great rise
            in prices, it rather helped the peasantry. They had a better
            market for their produce, and they so profited by it that the
            burghers spoke of denying them the right of free markets, on the
            ground that they had begun to usurp the place of the merchants
            and were trafficking in gold by lending money on interest. The
            competition in luxurious dress and living, which the impoverished
            nobles carried on with the rich burghers, made the former still
            poorer and more reckless. We read of a noble lady in Swabia who,
            rather than be outshone at a tournament, sold a village and all
            her rights over it in order to buy a blue velvet dress. The
            nobles, becoming poorer and poorer, saw their own peasants making
            money to such an extent that they were, comparatively speaking,
            much better off than themselves, so that in Westphalia it was
            said that a peasant could get credit more easily than five
            nobles.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, the
            peasants did not appear to be as submissive to their lords as
            they once had been. Nor was it to be wondered at. The creation of
            the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">landsknechts</span></span>
            had put new thoughts into their heads. The days of the old
            fighting chivalry were over, and the strength of armies was
            measured by the number and discipline of the infantry. The
            victories of the Swiss over Charles the Bold had made the peasant
            or artisan soldier a power. Kings and princes raised standing
            armies, recruited from the country districts or from among the
            wilder and more restless of the town population. The folk-songs
            are full of the doings of these plebeian soldiers. When the
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">landsknecht</span></span>
            visited his relations in village or in town, swaggered about in
            his gorgeous parti-coloured clothes, his broad hat adorned with
            huge feathers, his great gauntlets and his weapons; when he
            showed a gold chain or his ducats, or a jewel he had won as his
            share of the booty; when his old neighbours saw his <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id=
            "Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dress and gait imitated by
            the young burghers,—he became a centre of admiration, and his
            relations began to hold themselves high on his account. They
            acquired a new independence of character, a new impatience
            against all that prevented them from rising in the world. It has
            scarcely been sufficiently noted how most of the leaders in the
            plebeian risings were disbanded <span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">landsknechts</span></span>.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The new
            jurisprudence was a very effectual instrument in the hands of an
            impoverished landlord class to ease the peasant of his
            superfluous wealth, and to keep him in his proper place. It was
            used almost universally, and the peasant rebellions were the
            natural consequences. But the more determined peasant revolts,
            which began with the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bundschuh</span></span> League, arose at a
            time when life was hard for peasant and artisan alike.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last
            decade of the fifteenth century and the first of the sixteenth
            contained a number of years in which the harvest failed almost
            entirely over all or in parts of Germany. They began with 1490,
            and in that year contemporary writers, like Trithemius, declare
            that the lot of the poor was almost unbearable. The bad harvests
            of 1491 and 1492 made things worse. In 1493, the year which saw
            the foundation of the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bundschuh</span></span>, the state of
            matters may be guessed from the fact that men came all the way
            from the Tyrol to the upper reaches of the Main, where the
            harvest was comparatively good, bought barley <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id=
            "Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> there for five times its
            usual price, carried it on pack-horses by little frequented paths
            to their own country, and sold it at a profit.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1499 the
            Swiss refused to submit to the imperial proposals for
            consolidating the Empire. Maximilian or his government in the
            Tyrol resolved to punish them, and the Swabian League were to be
            the executioners. The Swiss, highly incensed, had declared that
            if they were forced into war it would be a war of extermination.
            They were as bad as their word. An eye-witness saw whole villages
            in the wasted districts forsaken by the men, and the women
            gathered in troops, feeding on herbs and roots, and seeing with
            the apathy of despair their ranks diminish clay by day.<a id=
            "noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a> The
            Swiss war was worse than many bad harvests for the Hegau and
            other districts in South Germany.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1500 the
            harvest failed over all Germany; 1501 and 1502 were years when
            the crops failed in a number of districts; and in 1503 there was
            another universally bad harvest. These years of scarcity pressed
            most heavily on the peasant class. In some districts of
            Brandenburg, peasants were found in the woods dead of starvation,
            with the grass which they had been trying to eat still in their
            mouths. Cities like Augsburg and Strassburg bought grain, stored
            it in magazines, and kept the poor alive by periodical
            distributions. This cycle of famine years from 1490 to 1503 was
            the period when the most determined and desperate social risings
            took place, and largely explains them.<a id="noteref_66" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our
            description of the social conditions existing during the period
            which ushered in the Reformation has been confined to Germany.
            The great religious movement took its origin in that land, and it
            is of the utmost importance to study the environment there. But
            the universal economic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg
            112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            changes were producing social disturbances everywhere, modified
            in appearance and character by the special conditions of the
            various countries of Europe. The popular risings in England,
            which began with the gigantic labour strike under Wat Tyler and
            priest Ball, and ended with the disturbances during the reign of
            Edward <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vi.</span></span>, were the
            counterpart of the social revolt in Germany.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From all that
            has been said, it will be evident that on the eve of the
            Reformation the condition of Europe, and of Germany in
            particular, was one of seething discontent and full of bitter
            class hatreds,—the trading companies and the great capitalists
            against the <span class="tei tei-q">“gilds,”</span> the poorer
            classes against the wealthier, and the nobles against the towns.
            This state of things is abundantly reflected in the folk-songs of
            the period, which best reveal the intimate feelings of the
            people. For it was an age of song everywhere, and especially in
            Germany. Nobles and knights, burghers and peasants, <span lang=
            "de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">landsknechts</span></span> and Swiss
            soldiers, priests and clerks, lawyers and merchants—all expressed
            the feelings of their class when they sang; and the folk-songs
            give us a wonderful picture of the class hatreds which were
            rending asunder the old conditions of mediæval life, and
            preparing the way for a new world.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This social
            ferment was increased by a sudden and mysterious rise in prices,
            affecting first the articles of foreign produce, to which the
            wealthier classes had become greatly addicted, and at last the
            ordinary necessaries of life. The cause, it is now believed, was
            not the debasing of the coinage, for that affected a narrow
            circle only; nor was it the importation of precious metals from
            America, for that came later; it was rather the increased output
            of the mines in Europe. Whatever the cause, the thing was to
            contemporaries an irritating mystery, and each class in society
            was disposed to blame the others for it. We have thus at the
            beginning of the sixteenth century a restless social condition in
            Germany, caused in great measure by economic causes which no one
            understood, but whose results were painfully manifest in the
            crowds of sturdy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg
            113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            beggars who thronged the roads—the refuse of all classes in
            society, from the broken noble and the disbanded mercenary
            soldier to the ruined peasant, the workman out of employment, the
            begging friar, and the <span class="tei tei-q">“wandering
            student.”</span> It was into this mass of seething discontent
            that the spark of religious protest fell—the one thing needed to
            fire the train and kindle the social conflagration. This was the
            society to which Luther spoke, and its discontent was the
            sounding-board which made his words reverberate.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The real roots
            of the spiritual life of Luther and of the other Reformers ought
            to be sought for in the family and in the popular religious life
            of the times. It is the duty of the historian to discover, if
            possible, what religious instruction was given by parents to
            children in the pious homes out of which most of the Reformers
            came, and what religious influences confronted and surrounded
            pious lads after they had left the family circle. Few have cared
            to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name=

            difficult task; and it is only within late years that the
            requisite material has been accumulated. It has to be sought for
            in autobiographies, diaries, and private letters; in the books of
            popular devotion which the patience of ecclesiastical
            archæologists is exhuming and reprinting; in the references to
            the pious confraternities of the later Middle Ages, and more
            especially to the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Kalands</span></span> among the artisans,
            which appear in town chronicles, and whose constitutions are
            being slowly unearthed by local historical societies; in the
            police regulations of towns and country districts which aim at
            curbing the power of the clergy, and in the edicts of princes
            attempting to enforce some of the recommendations of the Councils
            of Constance and Basel; in the more popular hymns of the time,
            and in the sermons of the more fervent preachers; in the pilgrim
            songs and the pilgrim guide-books; and in a variety of other
            sources not commonly studied by Church historians.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the surface
            no land seemed more devoted to the mediæval Church and to the
            Pope, its head, than did Germany in the half century before the
            Reformation. A cultivated Italian, Aleander, papal nuncio at the
            Diet of Worms, was astonished at the signs of disaffection he met
            with in 1520.<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href=
            "#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a> He
            had visited Germany frequently, and he was intimately acquainted
            with many of the northern Humanists; and his opinion was that
            down to 1510 (the date of his last visit) he had never been among
            a people so devoted to the Bishop of Rome. No nation had
            exhibited such signs of delight at the ending of the Schism and
            the re-establishment of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Peace of the
            Church.”</span> The Italian Humanists continually express their
            wonder at the strength of the religious susceptibilities of the
            Germans; and the papal Curia looked upon German devotion as a
            never-failing source of Roman revenue. The Germans displayed an
            almost feverish anxiety to profit by all the ordinary and
            extraordinary means of grace. They built innumerable churches;
            their towns were full of conventual <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> foundations; they bought Indulgences, went
            on pilgrimages, visited shrines, reverenced relics in a way that
            no other nation did. The piety of the Germans was proverbial.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The number of
            churches was enormous for the population. Almost every tiny
            village had its chapel, and every town of any size had several
            churches. Church building and decoration was a feature of the
            age. In the town of Dantzig 8 new churches had been founded or
            completed during the fifteenth century. The <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“holy”</span> city of Köln (Cologne) at the close of
            the fifteenth century contained 11 great churches, 19 parish
            churches, 22 monasteries, 12 hospitals, and 76 convents; more
            than a thousand Masses were said at its altars every day. It was
            exceptionally rich in ecclesiastical buildings, no doubt; but the
            smaller town of Brunswick had 15 churches, over 20 chapels, 5
            monasteries, 6 hospitals, and 12 Beguine-houses, and its great
            church, dedicated to St. Blasius, had 26 altars served by 60
            ecclesiastics. So it was all over Germany.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
            large numbers of monks and nuns who peopled the innumerable
            monasteries and convents, a large part of the population belonged
            to some semi-ecclesiastical association. Many were tertiaries of
            St. Francis; many were connected with the Beguines: Köln
            (Cologne) had 106 Beguine-houses; Strassburg, over 60, and Basel,
            over 30.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The churches
            and chapels, monasteries and religious houses, received all kinds
            of offerings from rich and poor alike. In those days of
            unexampled burgher prosperity and wealth, the town churches
            became <span class="tei tei-q">“museums and
            treasure-houses.”</span> The windows were filled with painted
            glass; weapons, armour, jewels, pictures, tapestries were stored
            in the treasuries or adorned the walls. Ancient inventories have
            been preserved of some of these ecclesiastical accumulations of
            wealth. In the cathedral church in Bern, to take one example, the
            head of St. Vincentius, the patron, was adorned with a great
            quantity of gold, and with one jewel said to be priceless; the
            treasury contained 70 gold and 50 silver cups, 2 silver coffers,
            and 450 costly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg
            117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            sacramental robes decked with jewels of great value. The luxury,
            the artistic fancy, and the wealth which could minister to both,
            all three were characteristic of the times, were lavished by the
            Germans on their churches.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
            hand, preaching took a place it had never previously held in the
            mediæval Church. Some distinguished Churchmen did not hesitate to
            say that it was the most important duty the priest could
            perform—more important than saying Mass. It was recognised that
            when the people began to read the Bible and religious books in
            the vernacular, it became necessary for the priests to be able to
            instruct their congregations intelligently and sympathetically in
            sermons. Attempts were made to provide the preachers with
            material for their sermon-making. The earliest was the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Biblia
            Pauperum</span></span> (the Bible for the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pauperes
            Christi</span></span>, or the preaching monks), which collects on
            one page pictures of Bible histories fitted to explain each
            other, and adds short comments. Thus, on the twenty-fifth leaf
            there are three pictures—in the centre the Crucifixion; on the
            left Abraham about to slay Isaac, with the lamb in the
            foreground; and on the left the Brazen Serpent and the healing of
            the Plague. More scholarly preachers found a valuable commentary
            in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Postilla</span></span> of the learned
            Franciscan Nicolas de Lyra (Lira or Lire, a village in Normandy),
            who was the first real exegetical scholar, and to whom Luther was
            in later days greatly indebted.<a id="noteref_69" name=
            "noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Manuals of
            Pastoral Theology were also written and published for the benefit
            of the parish priests,—the most famous, under the quaint title,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dormi
            Secure</span></span> (sleep in safety). It describes the more
            important portions of the service, and what makes a good sermon;
            it gives the Lessons for the Sunday services, the chief articles
            of the Christian faith, find adds directions for pastoral work
            and the cure of souls. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg

            It is somewhat difficult to describe briefly the character of the
            preaching. Some of it was very edifying and deservedly popular.
            The sermons of John Herolt were printed, and attained a very wide
            circulation. No fewer than forty-one editions appeared. Much of
            the preaching was the exposition of themes taken from the
            Scholastic Theology treated in the most technical way. Many of
            the preachers seem to have profaned their office in the search
            after popularity, and mingled very questionable stories and
            coarse jokes with their exhortations. The best known of the
            preachers who flourished at the close of the fifteenth century
            was John Geiler of Keysersberg (in Elsass near Colmar), the
            friend of Sebastian Brand, and a member of the Humanist circle of
            Strassburg. The position he filled illustrates the eagerness of
            men of the time to encourage preaching. A burgher of Strassburg,
            Peter Schott, left a sum of money to endow a preacher, who was to
            be a doctor of theology, one who had not taken monk's vows, and
            who was to preach to the people in the vernacular; a special
            pulpit was erected in the Strassburg Minster for the preacher
            provided by this foundation, who was John Geiler. His sermons are
            full of exhortations to piety and correct living. He lashed the
            vices and superstitions of his time. He denounced relic worship,
            pilgrimages, buying indulgences, and the corruptions in the
            monasteries and convents. He spoke against the luxurious living
            of Popes and prelates, and their trafficking in the sale of
            benefices. He made sarcastic references to the papal decretals
            and to the quibblings of Scholastic Theology. He paints the
            luxuries and vices he denounced so very clearly, that his
            writings are a valuable mine for the historian of popular morals.
            He was a stern preacher of morals, but his sermons contain very
            little of the gospel message. As we read them we can understand
            Luther's complaint, that while he had listened to many a sermon
            on the sins of the age, and to many a discourse expounding
            scholastic themes, he had never heard one which declared the love
            of God to man in the mission and work of Jesus Christ.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Church
            itself, recognising the fondness of the people for all kinds of
            scenic display, delighted to gratify the prevailing taste by
            magnificent processions, by gorgeous church ceremonial, by
            Passion and Miracle Plays. Such scenes are continually described
            in contemporary chronicles. The processions were arranged for
            Corpus Christi Day, for Christmas, for Harvest Thanksgivings,
            when the civic fathers requested the clergy to pray for rain, or
            when a great papal official visited the town. We hear of one at
            Erfurt which began at five o'clock in the morning, and, with its
            visits to the stations of the Cross and the services at each, did
            not end till noon. The school children of the town, numbering
            948, headed the procession, then came 312 priests, then the whole
            University,—in all, 2141 persons,—and the monks belonging to the
            five monasteries followed. The Holy Sacrament carried by the
            chief ecclesiastics, and preceded by a large number of gigantic
            candles, occupied the middle of the procession. The town council
            followed, then all the townsmen, then the women and maidens. The
            troop of maidens was 2316 strong. They had garlands on their
            heads, and their hair flowed down over their shoulders; they
            carried lighted candles in their hands, and they marched modestly
            looking to the ground. Two beautiful girls walked at their head
            with banners, followed by four with lanterns. In the centre was
            the fairest, clad in black and barefoot, carrying a large and
            splendid cross, and by her side one of the town councillors
            chosen for his good looks. Everything was arranged with a view to
            artistic effect.<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href=
            "#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            of great use in instructing the people in the contents of
            Scripture, being almost always composed of biblical scenes and
            histories. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg

            They were often very elaborate; sometimes more than one hundred
            actors were needed to fill the parts; and the plays were
            frequently so lengthy that they lasted for two or three days. The
            ecclesiastical managers felt that the continuous presentation of
            grave and lofty scenes and sentiments might weary their
            audiences, and they mixed them with lighter ones, which
            frequently degenerated into buffoonery and worse. The sacred and
            severe pathos of the Passion was interlarded with coarse jokes
            about the devil; and the most solemn conceptions were profaned.
            These Mysteries were generally performed in the great churches,
            and the buildings dedicated to sacred things witnessed scenes of
            the coarsest humour, to the detriment of all religious feeling.
            The more serious Churchmen felt the profanation, and tried to
            prohibit the performance of plays interlarded with rude and
            indecent scenes within the churches and churchyards. Their
            interference came too late; the rough popular taste demanded what
            it had been accustomed to; sacred histories and customs coming
            down from a primitive heathenism were mixed together, and the
            people lost the sense of sacredness which ought to attach itself
            to the former. The Feast of the Ass, to mention one, was supposed
            to commemorate the Flight to Egypt. A beautiful girl, holding a
            child in her lap, was seated on an ass decked with splendid
            trappings of gold cloth, and was led in procession by the clergy
            through the principal streets of the town to the parish church.
            The girl on her ass was conducted into the church and placed near
            the high altar, and the Mass and other services were each
            concluded by the whole congregation braying. There is indeed an
            old MS. extant with a rubric which orders the priest to bray
            thrice on elevating the Host.<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72"

            other seasons of popular licence, all the parts of the church

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this,
            however, tells us little about the intimate religious life and
            feelings of the people, which is the important matter for the
            study of the roots of the great ecclesiastical revolt.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
            evidence collected from the sources is sifted, it will be found
            that the religious life of the people at the close of the
            fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries is full of
            discordant elements, and makes what must appear to us a very
            incongruous mosaic. If classification be permissible, which it
            scarcely is (for religious types always refuse to be kept
            distinct, and always tend to run into each other), one would be
            disposed to speak of the simple homely piety of the family
            circle—the religion taught at the mother's knee, the <span lang=

            "font-style: italic">Kinderlehre</span></span>, as Luther called
            it; of a certain flamboyant religion which inspired the crowds;
            of a calm anti-clerical religion which grew and spread silently
            throughout Germany; of the piety of the praying-circles, the
            descendants of the fourteenth century Mystics.</p>

            biographies of some of the leaders of the Reformation, when they
            relate the childish reminiscences of the writers, bear
            unconscious witness to the kind of religion which was taught to
            the children in pious burgher and peasant families. We know that
            Luther learned the Creed, the Ten Commandments, and the Lord's
            Prayer. He knew such simple evangelical hymns as <span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor was direct
            simple evangelical instruction lacking. Friedrich Mecum (known
            better by his Latinised name of Myconius), who was born in 1491,
            relates how his father, a substantial burgher belonging to
            Lichtenfels in Upper Franconia, instructed him in religion while
            he was a child. <span class="tei tei-q">“My dear father,”</span>
            he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“had taught me in my childhood
            the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, and the Creed, and
            constrained me to pray always. For, said he, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">‘Everything comes to us from God alone, and that
            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratis</span></span>, free
            of cost, and He will lead us and rule us, if we only diligently
            pray to Him.’</span> ”</span> We can trace this simple
            evangelical family religion away back through the Middle Ages. In
            the wonderfully interesting Chronicle of Brother Salimbene of the
            Franciscan Convent of Parma, which comes from the thirteenth
            century, we are told how many of the better-disposed burghers of
            the town came to the convent frequently to enjoy the religious
            conversation of Brother Hugh. On one occasion the conversation
            turned upon the mystical theology of Abbot Giaocchino di Fiore.
            The burghers professed to be greatly edified, but said that they
            hoped that on the next evening Brother Hugh would confine himself
            to telling them the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">simple words of Jesus</span></em>.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The central
            thought in all evangelical religion is that the believer does not
            owe his position before God, and his assurance of salvation, to
            the good deeds which he really can do, but to the grace of God
            manifested in the mission and the work of Christ; and the more we
            turn <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg
            125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            from the thought of what we can do to the thought of what God has
            done for us, the stronger will be the conviction that simple
            trust in God is that by which the pardoning grace of God is
            appropriated. This double conception—God's grace coming down upon
            us from above, and the believer's trust rising from beneath to
            meet and appropriate it—was never absent from the simplest
            religion of the Middle Ages. It did not find articulate
            expression in mediæval theology, for, owing to its enforced
            connection with Aristotelian philosophy, that theology was
            largely artificial; but the thought itself had a continuous and
            constant existence in the public consciousness of Christian men
            and women, and appeared in sermons, prayers, and hymns, and in
            the other ways in which the devotional life manifested itself. It
            is found in the sermons of the greatest of mediæval preachers,
            Bernard of Clairvaux, and in the teaching of the most persuasive
            of religious guides, Francis of Assisi. The one, Bernard, in
            spite of his theological training, was able to rise above the
            thought of human merit recommending the sinner to God; and the
            other, Francis, who had no theological training at all, insisted
            that he was fitted to lead a life of imitation simply because he
            had no personal merits whatsoever, and owed everything to the
            marvellous mercy and grace of God given freely to him in the work
            of Christ. The thought that all the good we can do comes from the
            wisdom and mercy of God, and that without these gifts of grace we
            are sinful and worthless—the feeling that all pardon and all holy
            living are free gifts of God's grace, was the central thought
            round which in mediæval, as in all times, the faith of simple and
            pious people twined itself. It found expression in the simpler
            mediæval hymns, Latin and German. The utter need for
            sin-pardoning grace is expressed and taught in the prayer of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Canon
            of the Mass</span></span>. It found its way, in spite of the
            theology, even into the official agenda of the Church, where the
            dying are told that they must repose their confidence upon Christ
            and His Passion as the sole ground of confidence in their
            salvation. If we take the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> fourth book of Thomas à Kempis'
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Imitatio Christi</span></span>, it is
            impossible to avoid seeing that his ideas about the sacrament of
            the Supper (in spite of the mistakes in them) kept alive in his
            mind the thought of a free grace of God, and that he had a clear
            conception that God's grace was freely given, and not merited by
            what man can do. For the main thought with pious mediæval
            Christians, however it might be overlaid with superstitious
            conceptions, was that they received in the sacrament a <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gift</span></em>
            of overwhelming greatness. Many a modern Christian seems to think
            that the main idea is that in this sacrament one <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does</span></em>
            something—makes a profession of Christianity. The old view went a
            long way towards keeping people right in spite of errors, while
            the modern view does a great deal towards leading them wrong in
            spite of truth.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these
            things combine to show us how there was a simple evangelical
            faith among pious mediæval Christians, and that their lives were
            fed upon the same divine truths which lie at the basis of
            Reformation theology. The truths were all there, as poetic
            thoughts, as earnest supplication and confession, in fervent
            preaching or in fireside teaching. When mediæval Christians knelt
            in prayer, stood to sing their Redeemer's praises, spoke as a
            dying man to dying men, or as a mother to the children about her
            knees, the words and thoughts that came were what Luther and
            Zwingli and Calvin wove into Reformation creeds, and expanded
            into that experimental theology which was characteristic of the
            Reformation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
            printing-press began in the last decades of the fifteenth century
            to provide little books to aid private and family devotion, it is
            not surprising, after what has been said, to find how full many
            of them were of simple evangelical piety. Some contained the
            Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments, the Apostles' Creed, and
            occasionally a translation or paraphrase of some of the Psalms,
            notably the 51st Psalm. Popular religious instructions and
            catechisms for family use were printed. The Catechism of Dietrich
            Koelde (written in 1470) says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Man must
            place <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg
            127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            his faith and hope and love on God alone, and not in any
            creature; he must trust in nothing but in the work of Jesus
            Christ.”</span> The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Seelenwurzgartlein</span></span>, a widely
            used book of devotion, instructs the penitent: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Thou must place all thy hope and trust on nothing
            else than on the work and death of Jesus Christ.”</span> The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Geistliche Streit</span></span> of Ulrich
            Krafft (1503) teaches the dying man to place all his trust on the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“mercy and goodness of God, and not on
            his own good works.”</span> Quotations might be multiplied, all
            proving the existence of a simple evangelical piety, and showing
            that the home experience of Friedrich Mecum (Myconius) was shared
            in by thousands, and that there was a simple evangelical family
            religion in numberless German homes in the end of the fifteenth
            century.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When
            sensitive, religiously disposed boys left pious homes, they could
            not fail to come in contact with a very different kind of
            religion. Many did not need to quit the family circle in order to
            meet it. Near Mansfeld, Luther's home, were noted pilgrimage
            places. Pilgrims, singly or in great bands, passed to make their
            devotions before the wooden cross at Kyffhäuser, which was
            supposed to effect miraculous cures. The Bruno Quertfort Chapel
            and the old chapel at Welfesholz were pilgrimage places. Sick
            people were carried to spots near the cloister church at
            Wimmelberg, where they could best hear the sound of the cloister
            bells, which were believed to have a healing virtue.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The latter
            half of the fifteenth century witnessed a great and widespreading
            religious revival, which prolonged itself into the earlier
            decades of the sixteenth, though the year 1475 may perhaps be
            taken as its high-water mark. Its most characteristic feature was
            the impulse to make pilgrimages to favoured shrines; and these
            pilgrimages were always considered to be something in the nature
            of satisfactions made to God for sins. With some of the earlier
            phenomena we have nothing here to do.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The impetus to
            pilgrimages given after the great Schism by the celebration in
            1456 of the first Jubilee <span class="tei tei-q">“after healing
            the wounds of the Church”</span>; the relation of these
            pilgrimages to the doctrines of Indulgences which, formulated by
            the great Schoolmen of the thirteenth century, had changed the
            whole penitential system of the mediæval Church, must be passed
            over; the curious socialist, anti-clerical, and yet deeply
            superstitious movement led by the cowherd and village piper, Hans
            Böhm, has been described. But one movement is so characteristic
            of the times, that it must be noticed. In the years 1455-1459 all
            the chroniclers describe great gatherings of children from every
            part of Germany, from town and village, who, with crosses and
            banners, went on pilgrimage to St. Michael in Normandy. The
            chronicler of Lübeck compares the spread of the movement to the
            advance of the plague, and wonders whether the prompting arose
            from the inspiration of God or from the instigation of the devil.
            When a band of these child-pilgrims reached a town, carrying
            aloft crosses and banners blazoned with a rude image of St.
            Michael, singing their special pilgrim song,<a id="noteref_78"
            name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a> the
            town's children were impelled to join them. How this strange
            epidemic arose, and what put an end to it, seems altogether
            doubtful; but the chronicles of almost every important town in
            Germany attest the facts, and the contemporary records of North
            France describe the bands of youthful pilgrims who traversed the
            country to go to St. Michael's Mount.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During these
            last decades of the fifteenth century, a great fear seems to have
            brooded over Central Europe. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> The countries were scourged by incessant
            visits of the plague; new diseases, never before heard of, came
            to swell the terror of the people. The alarm of a Turkish
            invasion was always before their eyes. Bells tolled at midday in
            hundreds of German parishes, calling the parishioners together
            for prayer against the incoming of the Turks, and served to keep
            the dread always present to their minds. Mothers threatened their
            disobedient children by calling on the Turk to come and take
            them. It was fear that lay at the basis of this crude revival of
            religion which marks the closing decades of the fifteenth
            century. It gave rise to an urgent restlessness. Prophecies of
            evil were easily believed in. Astrologers assumed a place and
            wielded a power which was as new as it was strange. The credulous
            people welcomed all kinds of revelations and proclamations of
            miraculous signs. At Wilsnack, a village in one of the divisions
            of Brandenburg (Priegnitz), it had been alleged since 1383 that a
            consecrated wafer secreted the Blood of Christ. Suddenly, in
            1475, people were seized with a desire to make a pilgrimage to
            this shrine. Swarms of child-pilgrims again filled the roads—boys
            and girls, from eight to eighteen years of age, bareheaded, clad
            only in their shirts, shouting, <span class="tei tei-q">“O Lord,
            have mercy upon us”</span>—going to Wilsnack. Sometimes
            schoolmasters headed a crowd of pilgrims; mothers deserted their
            younger children; country lads and maids left their work in the
            fields to join the processions. These pilgrims came mostly from
            Central Germany (1100 from Eisleben alone), but the contagion
            spread to Austria and Hungary, and great bands of youthful
            pilgrims appeared from these countries. They travelled without
            provisions, and depended on the charity of the peasants for food.
            Large numbers of these child-pilgrims did not know why they had
            joined the throng; they had never heard of the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bleeding
            Host</span></span> towards which they were journeying; when asked
            why they had set out, they could only answer that they could not
            help it, that they saw the red cross at the head of their little
            band, and had to follow it. Many of them could not <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id=
            "Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> speak, all went weeping and
            groaning, shivering as if they had a fit of ague. An unnatural
            strength supported them. Little boys and girls, some of them not
            eight years old, from a small village near Bamberg, were said to
            have marched, on their first setting forth, all day and the first
            night the incredible distance of not less than eighty miles! Some
            towns tried to put a stop to these pilgrimages. Erfurt shut its
            gates against the youthful companies. The pilgrimages ended as
            suddenly as they had begun.<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79"
            href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Succeeding
            years witnessed similar astonishing pilgrimages—in 1489, to the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“black Mother of God”</span> in
            Altötting; in 1492, to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy
            Blood”</span> at Sternberg; in the same year, to the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“pitiful Bone”</span> at Dornach; in 1499, to the
            picture of the Blessed Virgin at Grimmenthal; in 1500, to the
            head of St. Anna at Düren; and in 1519, to the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Beautiful Mary”</span> at Regensburg.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apart
            altogether from these sporadic movements, the last decades of the
            fifteenth century were pre-eminently a time of pilgrimages.
            German princes and wealthy merchants made pilgrimages to the Holy
            Land, visited the sacred places there, and returned with numerous
            relics, which they stored in favourite churches. Frederick the
            Wise, the Elector of Saxony, to be known afterwards as the
            protector of Luther, made such a pilgrimage, and placed the
            relics he had acquired in the Castle Church (the Church of All
            Saints) in Wittenberg. He became an assiduous collector of
            relics, and had commissioners on the Rhine, in the Netherlands,
            and at Venice, with orders to procure him any sacred novelties
            they met with for sale.<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href=

            church on whose door Luther nailed his theses against Indulgences
            was one of the sacred edifices on which an Indulgence had been
            bestowed, and that the day selected <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            to the Holy Land was too costly and dangerous to be indulged in
            by many. The richer Germans made pilgrimages to Rome, and the
            great pilgrimage place for the middle-class or poorer Germans was
            Compostella in Spain. Einsiedeln, in Switzerland, also attracted
            yearly swarms of pilgrims.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Guide-books
            were written for the benefit of these pious travellers, and two
            of them, the most popular, have recently been reprinted. They are
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Mirabilia Romæ</span></span> for Roman
            pilgrims, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Walfart und Strasse zu Sant
            Jacob</span></span> for travellers to Compostella. These little
            books had a wonderful popularity. The <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mirabilia
            Romæ</span></span> went through nineteen Latin and at least
            twelve German editions before the year 1500; it was also
            translated into Italian and Dutch. It describes the various
            shrines at Rome where pilgrims may win special gifts of grace by
            visiting and worshipping at them. Who goes to the Lateran Church
            and worships there has <span class="tei tei-q">“forgiveness of
            all sins, both guilt and penalty.”</span> There is <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“a lovely little chapel”</span> (probably what is now
            called the Lateran Baptistry) near the Lateran, where the same
            privileges may be won. The pilgrim who goes with good intention
            to the High Altar of St. Peter's Church, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“even if he has murdered his father or his
            mother,”</span> is freed from all sin, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“guilt as well as penalty,”</span> provided he
            repents. The virtues of St. Croce seem to have been rated even
            higher. If a man leaves his house with the intention of going to
            the shrine, even if he die by the way, all his sins are forgiven
            him; and if he visits the church he wins a thousand years' relief
            from Purgatory.<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Compostella in
            Spain was the people's pilgrimage place. Before the invention of

            circulated among intending pilgrims, and afterwards the services
            of the printing-press were early called in to assist. In the
            Spanish archives at Simancas there are two single sheets, one of
            which states the numerous Indulgences for the benefit of visitors
            at the shrine of St. James, while the other enumerates the relics
            which are to be seen and visited there. It mentions thirty-nine
            great relics—from the bones of St. James, which lay under the
            great altar of the cathedral, to those of St. Susanna, which were
            interred in a church outside the walls of the town.<a id=

            These leaflets were sold to the pilgrims, and were carried back
            by them to Germany, where they stimulated the zeal and devotion
            of those who intended to make the pilgrimage. Our pilgrim's

            pairs of shoes, a water-bottle and spoon, a satchel and staff, a
            broad-brimmed hat and a cloak, both trimmed with leather in the
            places likeliest to be frayed, and both needed as a protection
            against wind and rain and snow.<a id="noteref_85" name=

            take permits from their parish priests to dispense with
            confession, for they were going to foreign lands where they would
            not find priests who spoke German. It warns them that they might
            die far from home and find a grave on the pilgrimage route. Our
            guide-book omits all these things. It is written by a man who has
            made the pilgrimage on foot; who had observed minutely all the
            turns of the road, and could warn fellow-pilgrims of the
            difficulties of the way. He gives the itinerary from town to
            town; where to turn to the right and where to the left; what
            conspicuous buildings mark the proper path; where the traveller
            will find people who are generous to poor pilgrims, and where the
            inhabitants are uncharitable and food and drink must be paid for;
            where hostels abound, and those parts of the road on which there
            are few, and where the pilgrims must buy their provisions
            beforehand and carry them in their satchels; where sick pilgrims
            can find hospitals on the way, and what treatment they may expect

            pilgrims to the renowned shrine of St. James of Compostella. This
            little book went through several editions between 1495 and 1521,
            and is of itself a proof of the popularity of this pilgrimage
            place. In the last decades of the fifteenth century there arose a
            body of men and women who might be called professional pilgrims,
            and who were continually on the road between Germany and Spain. A
            pilgrimage was one of the earliest so-called <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“satisfactions”</span> which might be done
            vicariously, and the Brethren of St. James (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Jacobs-Brueder</span></span>) made the
            pilgrimage regularly, either on behalf of themselves or of
            others.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of these

            gives several cases of criminals, who had committed murder or
            theft or other serious crimes between 1490 and 1520, who were
            sent to Santiago as a punishment. Even in the last decades of the
            fifteenth century, when the greater part of the pilgrims were
            devout in their way, it was known only too well that pilgrimages
            were not helpful to a moral life. Stern preachers of
            righteousness like Geiler of Keysersberg and Berchtold of
            Regensburg denounced pilgrimages, and said that they created more
            sins than they yielded pardons.<a id="noteref_89" name=
            "noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class=

            Parish priests continually forbade their women penitents,
            especially if they were unmarried, from going on a pilgrimage.
            But these warnings and rebukes were in vain. The prevailing
            terror had possessed the people, and they journeyed from shrine
            to shrine seeking some relief for their stricken consciences.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A marked
            characteristic of this revival which found such striking outcome
            in these pilgrimages was the thought that Jesus was to be looked
            upon as the Judge who was to come to punish the wicked. His
            saving and intercessory work was thrust into the background. Men
            forgot that He was the Saviour and the Intercessor; and
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name=
            "Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as the human heart
            craves for someone to intercede for it, another intercessor had
            to be found. This gracious personality was discovered in the
            Virgin Mother, who was to be entreated to intercede with her Son
            on behalf of poor sinning human creatures. The last half of the
            fifteenth century saw a deep-seated and widely-spread craving to
            cling to the protection of the Virgin Mother with a strength and
            intensity hitherto unknown in mediæval religion. It witnessed the
            furthest advance that had yet been made towards what must be
            called Mariolatry. This devotion expressed itself, as religious
            emotion continually does, in hymns; a very large proportion of
            the mediæval hymns in praise of the Virgin were written in the
            second half of the fifteenth century—the period of this strange
            revival based upon fear. Dread of the Son as Judge gave rise to
            the devotion to the Mother as the intercessor. Little books for
            private and family devotion were printed, bearing such titles as
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Pearl of the Passion</span></span> and the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Little
            Gospel</span></span>, containing, with long comments, the words
            of our Lord on the cross to John and to Mary. She became the
            ideal woman, the ideal mother, the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Mother of God,”</span> the <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">mater dolorosa</span></span>, with her heart
            pierced by the sword, the sharer in the redemptive sufferings of
            her Son, retaining her sensitive woman's heart, ready to listen
            to the appeals of a suffering, sorrowful humanity. We can see
            this devotion to the Virgin Mother impregnating the social
            revolts from Hans Böhm to Joss Fritz. The theology of the schools
            followed in the wake of the popular sentiment, and the doctrine
            of the Immaculate Conception was more strictly defined and found
            its most strenuous supporters during the later decades of this
            fifteenth century.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thought of
            motherly intercession went further; the Virgin herself had to be
            interceded with to induce her to plead with her Son for men sunk
            in sin, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">her</span></em> mother (St. Anna) became the
            object of a cult which may almost be said to be quite new. Hymns
            were written in her praise.<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90"
            href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a>
            Confraternities, modelled on the confraternities <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id=
            "Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dedicated to the Blessed
            Virgin, were formed in order to bring the power of the prayers of
            numbers to bear upon her. These confraternities spread all over
            Germany and beyond it.<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href=
            "#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> It
            is almost possible to trace the widening area of the cult from
            the chronicles of the period. The special cult of the Virgin
            seems to have begun, at least in its extravagant popular form, in
            North France, and to have spread from France through Germany and
            Spain; but so far as it can be traced, this cult of St. Anna,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Grandmother,”</span> had a German
            origin, and the devotion manifested itself most deeply on German
            soil. Even the Humanist poets sang her praises with enthusiasm,
            and such collectors of relics as Frederick of Saxony and the
            Cardinal Archbishop of Mainz rejoiced when they were able to add
            a thumb of St. Anna to their store. Luther himself tells us that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“St. Anna was his idol”</span>; and
            Calvin speaks of his mother's devotion to the saint. Her name was
            graven on many a parish church bell, and every pull at the ropes
            and clang of the bell was supposed to be a prayer to her to
            intercede. The Virgin and St. Anna brought in their train other
            saints who were also believed to be the true intercessors. The
            three bells of the church in which Luther was baptized bore the
            following inscriptions carved deeply in the brass:—<span class=
            "tei tei-q">“God help us; Mary have mercy. 1499.”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Help us Anna, also St. Peter, St. Paul.
            1509.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Help us God, Mary, Anna,
            St. Peter, Paul, Arnold, Stephan, Simon. 1509.”</span> The
            popular religion always represented Jesus, Mecum (Myconius) tells
            us, as the stern Judge who would convict and punish all those who
            had not secured righteousness by the intercession of the saints
            or by their own good works.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This revival
            of religion, crude as it was, and based on fear, had a distinct
            effect for good on a portion of the clergy, and led to a great
            reformation of morals among those who came under its influence.
            The papal Schism, which had lasted till 1449, had for one of its
            results the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg
            137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            weakening of all ecclesiastical discipline, and its consequences
            were seen in the growing immorality which pervaded all classes of
            the clergy. So far as one can judge, the revival of religion
            described above had not very much effect on the secular clergy.
            Whether we take the evidence from the chronicles of the time or
            from visitations of the bishops, the morals of the parish priests
            were extremely low, and the private lives of the higher clergy in
            Germany notoriously corrupt. The occupants of episcopal sees were
            for the most part the younger brothers of the great princes, and
            had been placed in the religious life for the sake of the
            ecclesiastical revenues. The author of the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chronicles of the
            Zimmer Family</span></span> tells us that at the festive
            gatherings which accompanied the meetings of the Diet, the young
            nobles, lay and clerical, spent most of their time at dice and
            cards. As he passed through the halls, picking his way among
            groups of young nobles lying on the floor (for tables and chairs
            were rare in these days), he continually heard the young count
            call out to the young bishop, <span class="tei tei-q">“Play up,
            parson; it is your turn.”</span> The same writer describes the
            retinue of a great prelate, who was always accompanied to the
            Diet by a concubine dressed in man's clothes. Nor were the older
            Orders of monks, the Benedictines and their offshoots, greatly
            influenced by the revival. It was different, however, with those
            Orders of monks who came into close contact with the people, and
            caught from them the new fervour. The Dominicans, the great
            preaching Order, were permeated by reform. The Franciscans, who
            had degenerated sadly from their earlier lives of self-denial,
            partook of a new life. Convent after convent reformed itself, and
            the inmates began to lead again the lives their founder had
            contemplated. The fire of the revival, however, burnt brightest
            among the Augustinian Eremites, the Order which Luther joined,
            and they represented, as none of the others did, all the
            characteristics of the new movement.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
            Augustinian Eremites had a somewhat curious <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id=
            "Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> history. They had nothing in
            common with St. Augustine save the name, and the fact that a Pope
            had given them the rule of St. Augustine as a basis for their
            monastic constitution. They had originally been hermits, living
            solitary lives in mountainous parts of Italy and of Germany. Many
            Popes had desired to bring them under conventual rule, and this
            was at last successfully done. They shared as no other Order had
            done in the revival of the second half of the fifteenth century,
            and exhibited in their lives all its religious characteristics.
            No Order of monks contained such devoted servants of the Virgin
            Mother. She was the patron along with St. Augustine. Her image
            stood in the chapter-house of every convent. The theologians of
            the Augustinian Eremites vied with those of the Franciscans in
            spreading the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. They did
            much to spread the cult of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed
            Anna.”</span> They were devoted to the Papacy. One of their
            learned men, John of Palz, one of the two professors of theology
            in the Erfurt Convent when Luther entered it as a novice, was the
            most strenuous defender of the doctrine of Attrition and of the
            religious value of Indulgences. With all this their lives were
            more self-denying than those of most monks. They cultivated
            theological learning, and few Universities in Germany were
            without an Augustinian Eremite who acted as professor of
            philosophy or of theology. They also paid great attention to the
            art of preaching, and every large monastery had a special
            preacher who attracted crowds of the laity to the convent chapel.
            Their monasteries were usually placed in large towns; and their
            devout lives, their learning, and the popular gifts of their
            preachers, made them favourites with the townspeople. They were
            the most esteemed Order in Germany.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These last
            decades of the fifteenth century were the days of the
            resuscitation of the mendicant Orders and the revival of their
            power over the people. The better disposed among the princes and
            among the wealthier burghers invariably selected their confessors
            from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg
            139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            monks of the mendicant Orders, and especially from the
            Augustinian Eremites. The chapels of the Franciscans and of the
            Eremites were thronged, and those of the parish clergy were
            deserted. The common people took for their religious guides men
            who shared the new revival, and who proved their sincerity by
            self-denying labours. It was in vain that the Roman Curia
            published regulations insisting that every parishioner must
            confess to the priest of the parish at least once a year, and
            that it explained again and again that the personal character of
            the ministrant did not affect the efficacy of the sacraments
            administered by him. So long as poorly clad, emaciated,
            clean-living Franciscan or Eremite priests could be found to act
            as confessors, priests, or preachers, the people deserted the
            parish clergy, flocked to their confessionals, waited on their
            serving the Mass, and thronged their chapels to listen to their
            sermons. These decades were the time of the last revival of the
            mendicant monks, who were the religious guides in this flamboyant
            popular religion which is so much in evidence during our
            period.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The third
            religious movement which belongs to the last decades of the
            fifteenth and the earlier decades of the sixteenth century was of
            a kind so different from, and even contrary to, what has just
            been described, that it is with some surprise that the student
            finds he must recognise its presence alongside of the other. It
            was the silent spread of a quiet, sincere, but non-ecclesiastical
            religion. Historians usually say nothing about this movement, and
            it is only a minute study of the town chronicles and of the
            records of provincial and municipal legislation that reveals its
            power and extent. It has always been recognised that Luther's
            father was a man of a deeply religious turn of mind, although he
            commonly despised the clergy, and thought that most monks were
            rogues or fools; but what is not recognised is that in this he
            represented thousands of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> quiet and pious Germans in all classes of
            society. We find traces of the silent, widespreading movement in
            the ecclesiastical legislation of German princes, in the police
            regulations, and in the provisions for the support of the poor
            among the burghers; in the constitutions and practices of the
            confraternities among the lower classes, and especially among the
            artisans in the towns; and in the numerous translations of the
            Vulgate into the vernacular.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reforms
            sketched by the Councils of Constance and of Basel had been
            utterly neglected by the Roman Curia, and in consequence several
            German princes, while they felt the hopelessness of insisting on
            a general purification of the Church, resolved that these reforms
            should be carried out within their own dominions. As early as
            1446, Duke William of Saxony had published decrees which
            interfered with the pretensions of the Church to be quite
            independent of the State. His regulations about the observance of
            the Sunday, his forbidding ecclesiastical courts to interfere
            with Saxon laymen, his stern refusal to allow any Saxon to appeal
            to a foreign jurisdiction, were all more or less instances of the
            interference of the secular power within what had been supposed
            to be the exclusive province of the ecclesiastical. He went much
            further, however. He enacted that it belonged to the secular
            power to see that parish priests and their superiors within his
            dominions lived lives befitting their vocation—a conception which
            was entirely at variance with the ecclesiastical pretensions of
            the Middle Ages. He also declared it to be within the province of
            the secular power to visit officially and to reform all the
            convents within his dominions. So far as proofs go, it is
            probable that these declarations about the rights of the civil
            authorities to exercise discipline over the parish priests and
            their superiors remained a dead letter. We hear of no such
            reformation being carried out. But the visitation of the Saxon
            monasteries was put in force in spite of the protests of the
            ecclesiastical powers. Andreas Proles would never have been able
            to carry out his proposals of reform in the convents of the
            Augustinian Eremites but <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> for the support he received from the
            secular princes against his ecclesiastical superiors in Rome. The
            Dukes Ernest and Albrecht carried out Duke William's conceptions
            about the relation of the civil to the ecclesiastical authorities
            in their ordinances of 1483, and the Elector Frederick the Wise
            was heir to this ecclesiastical policy of his family.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The records of
            the Electorate of Brandenburg, investigated by Priebatsch and
            described by him in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            testify to the same ideas at work there. A pious prince like
            Frederick <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span> of Brandenburg
            removed unworthy Church dignitaries and reinstituted them, thus
            taking upon himself the oversight of the Church. Appeals to Rome
            were forbidden under penalties. Gradually under Frederick and his
            successors there arose what was practically a national Church of
            Brandenburg, which was almost completely under the control of the
            civil power, and almost entirely separated from Roman
            control.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The towns also
            interfered in what had hitherto been believed to be within the
            exclusive domain of the ecclesiastical authorities. They
            recognised the harm which the numerous Church festivals and
            saints' days were doing to the people, and passed regulations
            about their observance, all of them tending to lessen the number
            of the days on which men were compelled by ecclesiastical law to
            be idle. When Luther pleaded in his <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Address to the
            Nobility of the German Nation</span></span> for the abolition of
            the ecclesiastical laws enforcing idleness on the numerous
            ecclesiastical holy days, he only suggested an extension and
            wider application of the police regulations which were in force
            within his native district of Mansfeld.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
            non-ecclesiastical feeling appears strongly in the change of view
            about Christian charity which marks the close of the fifteenth
            century.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing shows
            how the Church of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries had
            instilled the mind of Jesus into the peoples of Europe like the
            zeal with which they tried to do their duty by the poor, the
            sick, and the helpless. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">were sisters
            of mercy in every mediæval town. Unfortunately the lessons of the
            Church included the thought that begging was a Christian virtue;
            while the idea that because charity is taught by the law of
            Christ, its exercise must be everywhere superintended by
            ecclesiastics, was elevated to a definite principle of action, if
            not to something directly commanded by the law of God. The
            Reformation protested against these two ideas, and the silent
            anticipation of this protest is to be found in the
            non-ecclesiastical piety of the close of the fifteenth
            century.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The practice
            of begging, its toleration and even encouragement, was almost
            universal. In some of the benevolent institutions the sick and
            the pensioners were provided from the endowment with all the
            necessaries of life, but it was generally thought becoming that
            they should beg them from the charitable. The very fact of
            begging seemed to raise those who shared in it to the level of
            members of a religious association. St. Francis, the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“imitator of Christ,”</span> had taught his followers
            to beg, and this great example sanctified the practice. It is
            true that the begging friars were always the butt of the
            satirists of the close of the fifteenth century. They delighted
            to portray the mendicant monk, with his sack, into which he
            seemed able to stuff everything: honey and spice, nutmegs,
            pepper, and preserved ginger, cabbage and eggs, poultry, fish,
            and new clothes, milk, butter, and cheese; cheese especially, and
            of all kinds—ewe's milk and goat's milk, hard cheese and soft
            cheese, large cheeses and small cheeses—were greedily
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name=
            "Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> demanded by these
            <span class="tei tei-q">“cheese hunters,”</span> as they were
            satirically called. On their heels tramped a host of
            semi-ecclesiastical beggars, all of them with professional
            names—men who begged for a church that was building, or for an
            altar-cloth, or to hansel a young priest at his first Mass; men
            who carried relics about for the charitable to kiss—some straw
            from the manger of Bethlehem, or a feather from the wing of the
            angel Gabriel; the Brethren of St. James, who performed continual
            and vicarious pilgrimages to Compostella, and sometimes robbed
            and murdered on the road; the Brethren of St. Anthony, who had
            the special privilege of wearing a cross and carrying a bell on
            their begging visits. These were all ecclesiastical beggars. The
            ordinary beggars did their best to obtain some share of the
            sanctity which surrounded the profession; they carried with them
            the picture of some saint, or placed the cockle-shell, the badge
            of a pilgrim, in their hats, and secured a quasi-ecclesiastical
            standing.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href=
            "#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>
            Luther expressed not merely his own opinion on this plague of
            beggars in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Address to the Nobility of the German
            Nation</span></span>, but what had been thought and partially
            practised by quiet laymen for several decades. Some towns began
            to make regulations against promiscuous begging by able-bodied
            persons, provided work for them, seized their children, and
            taught them trades—all of which sensible doings were against the
            spirit of the mediæval Church.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            non-ecclesiastical religious feeling, however, appears much more
            clearly when the history of the charitable foundations is
            examined. The invariable custom during the earlier Middle Ages
            was that charitable bequests were left to the management of the
            Church and the clergy. At the close of the fifteenth century the
            custom began to alter. The change from clerical to lay management
            was at first probably due mainly to the degeneracy of the clergy,
            and to the belief that the funds set apart for the poor were not
            properly administered. The evidences of this are to be found in
            numerous instances of the civic <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> authorities attempting, and successfully,
            to take the management of charitable foundations out of the hands
            of ecclesiastical authorities, and to vest them in lay
            management. But this cannot have been the case always. We should
            rather say that it began to dawn upon men that although charity
            was part of the law of Christ, this did not necessarily mean that
            all charities must be placed under the control of the clergy or
            other ecclesiastical administrators. Hence we find during the
            later years of the fifteenth century continual instances of
            bequests for the poor placed in the hands of the town council or
            of boards of laymen. That this was done without any animus
            against the Church is proved by the fact that the same testator
            is found giving benefactions to foundations which are under
            clerical and to others under lay management. Out of the funds
            thus accumulated the town councils began a system of caring for
            the poor of the city, which consisted in giving tokens which
            could be exchanged for so much bread or woollen cloth, or shoes,
            or wood for firing, at the shops of dealers who were engaged for
            the purpose. How far this new and previously unheard of lay
            management, in what had hitherto been the peculiar possession of
            the clergy, had spread before the close of the fifteenth century,
            it is impossible to say. No archæologist has yet made an
            exhaustive study of the evidence lying buried in archives of the
            mediæval towns of Germany; but enough has been collected by
            Kriegk<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href=
            "#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> and
            others to show that it had become very extensive. The laity saw
            that they were quite able to perform this peculiarly Christian
            work apart from any clerical direction.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
            interesting series of facts serves also to show the growth of a
            non-ecclesiastical religious sentiment. The later decades of the
            fifteenth century saw the rise of innumerable associations, some
            of them definitely religious, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            "tei tei-anchor"></a> and all of them with a religious side,
            which are unlike what we meet with earlier. They did not aim to
            be, like the praying circles of the Mystics or of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Gottesfreunde, ecclesiolæ in
            ecclesia</span></span>, strictly non-clerical or even
            anti-clerical. They had no difficulty in placing themselves under
            the protection of the Church, in selecting the ordinary
            ecclesiastical buildings for their special services, and in
            employing priests to conduct their devotions; but they were
            distinctively lay associations, and lived a religious life in
            their own way, without any regard to the conceptions of the
            higher Christian life which the Church was accustomed to present
            to its devout disciples. Some were associations for prayer;
            others for the promotion of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“cult”</span> of a special saint, like the
            confraternities dedicated to the Virgin Mother or the
            associations which spread the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“cult”</span> of the Blessed Anna; but by far the
            largest number were combinations of artisans, and resembled the
            workmen's <span class="tei tei-q">“gilds”</span> of the Roman
            Empire.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps one of
            the best known of these associations formed for the purpose of
            encouraging prayer was the <span class="tei tei-q">“Brotherhood
            of the Eleven Thousand Virgins,”</span> commonly known under the
            quaint name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">St. Ursula's Little Ship</span></span>. The
            association was conceived by a Carthusian monk of Cologne, and it
            speedily became popular. Frederick the Wise was one of its
            patrons, his secretary, Dr. Pfeffinger, one of its supporters; it
            numbered its associates by the thousand; its praises were sung in
            a quaint old German hymn.<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96"
            href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a> No
            money dues were exacted from its members. The only duty exacted
            was to pray regularly, and to learn to better one's life through
            the power of prayer. This was one type of the pious brotherhoods
            of the fifteenth century. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> It was the best known of its kind, and
            there were many others. But among the brotherhoods which bear
            testimony to the spread of a non-ecclesiastical piety none are
            more important than the confraternities which went by the names
            of <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Kalands</span></span> or
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Kalandsgilden</span></span>
            in North Germany and <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Zechen</span></span> in Austria. These
            associations were useful in a variety of ways. They were unions
            for the practice of religion; for mutual aid in times of
            sickness; for defence in attack; and they also served the purpose
            of insurance societies and of burial clubs. It is with their
            religious side that we have here to do. It was part of the bond
            of association that all the brethren and sisters (for women were
            commonly admitted) should meet together at stated times for a
            common religious service. The brotherhood selected the church in
            which this was held, and so far as we can see the chapels of the
            Franciscans or of the Augustinian Eremites were generally chosen.
            Sometimes an altar was relegated to their exclusive use;
            sometimes, if the church was a large one, a special chapel. The
            interesting thing to be noticed is that the rules and the modes
            of conducting the religious services of the association were
            entirely in the hands of the brotherhood itself, and that these
            laymen insisted on regulating them in their own way. Luther has a
            very interesting sermon, entitled <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sermon upon the
            venerable Sacrament of the holy true Body of Christ and of the
            Brotherhoods</span></span>, the latter half of which is devoted
            to a contrast between good brotherhoods and evil ones. Those
            brotherhoods are evil, says Luther, in which the religion of the
            brethren is expressed in hearing a Mass on one or two days of the
            year, while by guzzling and drinking continually at the meetings
            of the brotherhood, they contrive to serve the devil the greater
            part of their time. A true brotherhood spreads its table for its
            poorer members, it aids those who are sick or infirm, it provides
            marriage portions for worthy young members of the association. He
            ends with a comparison between the true brotherhood and the
            Church of Christ. Theodore Kolde remarks that a careful monograph
            on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg
            147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            brotherhoods of the end of the fifteenth century in the light of
            this sermon of Luther's would afford great information about the
            popular religion of the period. Unfortunately, no one has yet
            attempted the task, but German archæologists are slowly preparing
            the way by printing, chiefly from MS. sources, accounts of the
            constitution and practices of many of these Kalands.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From all this
            it may be seen that there was in these last decades of the
            fifteenth and in the earlier of the sixteenth centuries the
            growth of what may be called a non-ecclesiastical piety, which
            was quietly determined to bring within the sphere of the laity
            very much that had been supposed to belong exclusively to the
            clergy. The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">jus
            episcopale</span></span> which Luther claimed for the civil
            authorities in his tract on the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Liberty of the
            Christian Man</span></span>, had, in part at least, been claimed
            and exercised in several of the German principalities and
            municipalities; the practice of Christian charity and its
            management were being taken out of the hands of the clergy and
            entrusted to the laity; and the brotherhoods were making it
            apparent that men could mark out their religious duties in a way
            deemed most suitable for themselves without asking any aid from
            the Church, further than to engage a priest whom they trusted to
            conduct divine service and say the Masses they had arranged
            for.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The appearance
            of numerous translations of the Scriptures into the vernacular,
            unauthorised by the officials of the mediæval Church, and
            jealously suspected by them, appears to confirm the growth and
            spread of this non-ecclesiastical piety. The relation of the
            Church of the Middle Ages, earlier and later, to vernacular
            translations of the Vulgate is a complex question. The Scriptures
            were always declared to be the supreme source and authority for
            all questions of doctrines and morals, and in the earlier stages
            of the Reformation controversy the supreme authority of the Holy
            Scriptures was not supposed to be one of the matters in dispute
            between the contending parties. This is evident when we remember
            that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Augsburg</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Confession</span></span>, unlike the later
            confessions of the Reformed Churches, does not contain any
            article affirming the supreme authority of Scripture. That was
            not supposed to be a matter of debate. It was reserved for the
            Council of Trent, for the first time, to place <span lang="la"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">traditiones sine Scripto</span></span> on
            the same level of authority with the Scriptures of the Old and
            New Testaments. Hence, many of the small books, issued from
            convent presses for the instruction of the people during the
            decades preceding the Reformation, frequently declare that the
            whole teaching of the Church is to be found within the books of
            the Holy Scriptures.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is, of
            course, undoubted that the mediæval Church forbade over and over
            again the reading of the Scriptures in the Vulgate and especially
            in the vernacular, but it may be asserted that these prohibitions
            were almost always connected with attempts to suppress heretical
            or schismatic revolts.<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href=
            "#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
            hand, no official encouragement of the reading of the Scriptures
            in the vernacular by the people can be found during the whole of
            the Middle Ages, nor any official patronage of vernacular
            translations. The utmost that was done in the way of tolerating,
            it can scarcely be said of encouraging, a knowledge of the
            vernacular Scriptures was the issue of Psalters in the
            vernacular, of Service-Books, and, in the fifteenth century, of
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Plenaria</span></span>—little books which
            contained translations of some of the paragraphs of the Gospels
            and Epistles read in the Church service accompanied with legends
            and popular tales. Translations of the Scriptures were
            continually reprobated <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg
            149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            by Popes and primates for various reasons.<a id="noteref_98"
            name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a> It
            is also unquestionable that a knowledge of the Scriptures in the
            vernacular, especially by uneducated men and women, was almost
            always deemed a sign of heretical tendency. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The third cause of heresy,”</span> says an Austrian
            inquisitor, writing about the end of the thirteenth century,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“is that they translate the Old and New
            Testaments into the vulgar tongue; and so they learn and teach. I
            have heard and seen a certain country clown who repeated the Book
            of Job word for word, and several who knew the New Testament
            perfectly.”</span><a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href=
            "#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a> A
            survey of the evidence seems to lead to the conclusion that the
            rulers of the mediæval Church regarded a knowledge of the
            vernacular Scriptures with grave suspicion, but that they did not
            go the length of condemning entirely their possession by persons
            esteemed trustworthy, whether clergy, monks, nuns, or
            distinguished laymen.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet we have in
            the later Middle Ages, ever since Wiclif produced his English
            version, the gradual publication of the Scriptures in the
            vernaculars of Europe. This was specially so in Germany; and when
            the invention of printing had made the diffusion of literature
            easy, it is noteworthy that the earliest presses in Germany
            printed many more books for family and private devotion, many
            more <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Plenaria</span></span>, and many more
            editions of the Bible than of the classics. Twenty-two editions
            of the Psalter in German appeared before 1509, and twenty-five of
            the Gospels and Epistles before 1518. No less than fourteen (some
            say seventeen) versions of the whole Bible were printed in
            High-German and three in Low-German during the last decades of
            the fifteenth and the earlier decades of the sixteenth
            century—all translations from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Vulgate. The first was issued by John
            Metzel in Strassburg in 1466. Then followed another Strassburg
            edition in 1470, two Augsburg editions in 1473, one in the Swiss
            dialect in 1474, two in Augsburg in 1477, one in Augsburg in
            1480, one in Nürnberg in 1483, one in Strassburg in 1485, and
            editions in Augsburg in 1487, 1490, 1507, and 1518. A careful
            comparison of these printed vernacular Bibles proves that the
            earlier editions were independent productions; but as edition
            succeeded edition the text became gradually assimilated until
            there came into existence a German Vulgate, which was used
            indiscriminately by those who adhered to the mediæval Church and
            those who were dissenters from it. These German versions were
            largely, but by no means completely, displaced by Luther's
            translation. The Anabaptists, for example, retained this German
            Vulgate long after the publication of Luther's version, and these
            pre-Reformation German Bibles were to be found in use almost two
            hundred years after the Reformation.<a id="noteref_100" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whence sprang
            the demand for these vernacular versions of the Holy Scriptures?
            That the leaders of the mediæval Church viewed their existence
            with alarm is evident from the proclamation of the Primate of
            Germany, Berthold of Mainz, issued in 1486, ordering a censorship
            of books with special reference to vernacular translations of the
            Scriptures.<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href=
            "#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a> On
            the other hand, there is no evidence that these versions were
            either wholly or in great part the work of enemies of the
            mediæval Church. The mediæval <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Brethren</span></span>, as they called
            themselves (Waldenses, Picards, Wiclifites, Hussites, etc., were
            names given to them very indiscriminately by the ecclesiastical
            authorities), had translations of the Scriptures both in the
            Romance and in the Teutonic languages as early as the close of
            the thirteenth century. The records of inquisitors and of
            councils prove it. But there is no evidence to connect any of
            these German versions, save, perhaps, one at Augsburg,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name=
            "Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and that issued by
            the Koburgers in Nürnberg, with these earlier translations. The
            growing spread of education in the fifteenth century, and, above
            all, the growth of a non-ecclesiastical piety which claimed to
            examine and to judge for itself, demanded and received these
            numerous versions of the Holy Scriptures in the vulgar
            tongue.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href=

            <span class="tei tei-q">“common man”</span> had the word of God
            in his hands, could read, meditate, and judge for himself. The
            effect of the presence of these vernacular Scriptures is apt to
            be exaggerated.<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href=
            "#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a> The
            Humanist, Conrad Celtes, might threaten the priests that the
            Bible would soon be seen in every village tavern; but we know
            that in these days of early printing a complete Bible must have
            been too expensive to be purchased by a poor man. Still he could
            get the Gospels or the Epistles, or the Psalter; and there is
            evidence, apart from the number of editions, that the people were
            buying and were studying the Scriptures. Preachers were exhorted
            to give the meaning of the passages of Scripture read in Church
            to prevent the people being confused by the different ways in
            which the text was translated in the Bibles in their possession.
            Stories were told of peasants, like Hans Werner, who worsted
            their parish priests in arguments drawn from Scripture. The
            ecclesiastical authorities were undoubtedly anxious, and their
            anxiety was shared by many who desired a reformation in life and
            manners, but dreaded any revolutionary movement. It was right
            that the children should be fed with the Bread of Life, but
            Mother Church ought to keep the bread-knife in her hands lest the
            children cut their fingers. Some publishers of the translations
            inserted prefaces saying that the contents of the volumes should
            be understood in the way taught by the Church, as was done in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of
            the Gospels</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            all a lay religion had come into being, and laymen were beginning
            to think for themselves in matters where ecclesiastics had
            hitherto been considered the sole judges.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was
            another type of religious life and pious association which
            existed, and which seems in one form or other to have exercised a
            great influence among the better class of artisans, and more
            especially among the printers of Augsburg, Nürnberg, and
            Strassburg.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
            that this type of piety had at least three roots.</p>

            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) We
            can trace as far back as the closing years of the thirteenth
            century, in many parts of Germany, the existence of
            nonconformists who, on the testimony of inquisitors, lived pious
            lives, acted righteously towards their neighbours, and believed
            in all the articles of the Christian faith, but repudiated the
            Roman Church and the clergy. Their persecutors gave them a high
            character. <span class="tei tei-q">“The heretics are known by
            their walk and conversation: they live quietly and modestly; they
            have no pride in dress; their learned men are tailors and
            weavers; they do not heap up riches, but are content with what is
            necessary; they live chastely; they are temperate in eating and
            drinking; they never go to taverns, nor to public dances, nor to
            any such vanities; they refrain from all foul language, from
            backbiting, from thoughtless speech, from lying and from
            swearing.”</span> The list of objections which they had to usages
            of the mediæval Church are those which would occur to any
            evangelical Protestant of this century. They professed a simple
            evangelical creed; they offered a passive resistance to the
            hierarchical and priestly pretensions of the clergy; they were
            careful to educate their children in schools which they
            supported; they had vernacular translations of the Scriptures,
            and committed large portions to memory; they conducted their
            religious service in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> vernacular, and it was one of the
            accusations made against them that they alleged that the word of
            God was as profitable when read in the vernacular as when studied
            in Latin. It is also interesting to know that they were accused
            of visiting the leper-houses to pray with the inmates, and that
            in some towns they had schools for the leper children.<a id=

            They called themselves the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Brethren</span></span>. The societies of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Brethren</span></span> had never died out.
            During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries they were
            continually subject to local and somewhat spasmodic persecutions,
            when the ecclesiastical could secure the aid of the secular
            authorities to their schemes of repression, which was not always
            possible. They were strongly represented among the artisans in
            the great cities, and there are instances when the civic
            authorities gave them one of the churches of the towns for their
            services. The liability to intermittent persecution led to an
            organisation whereby the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Brethren</span></span>, who were for the
            time being living in peace, made arrangements to receive and
            support those who were able to escape from any district where the
            persecution raged. These societies were in correspondence with
            their brethren all over Europe, and were never so active as
            during the last decades of the fifteenth and the first quarter of
            the sixteenth century.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) As
            early as the times of Meister Eckhart (d. 1327), of his disciples
            Tauler (d. 1361) and Suso (d 1366), of the mysterious
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Friend of God in the Oberland”</span>
            and his associates (among them the Strassburg merchant Rulman
            Merswin (d. 1382)), and of the Brussels curate John Ruysbroeck
            (d. 1381), the leaders of the mediæval Mystics had been
            accustomed to gather their followers together into praying
            circles; and the custom was perpetuated long after their
            departure. How these pious associations continued to exist in the
            half century before the Reformation, and what forms their
            organisation took, it seems impossible to say with any accuracy.
            The school system of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Gottesfreunde</span></span>, in all
            probability served to spread the praying circles which had come
            down from the earlier Mystics. It seems to have been a custom
            among these <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Brethren of the Common Lot</span></span> to
            invite their neighbours to meet in their schoolrooms or in a hall
            to listen to religious discourses. There they read and expounded
            the New Testament in the vernacular. They also read extracts from
            books written to convey popular religious instruction. They
            questioned their audience to find out how far their hearers
            understood their teaching, and endeavoured by question and answer
            to discover and solve religious difficulties. These schools and
            teachers had extended all over Germany by the close of the
            fifteenth century, and their effect in quickening and keeping
            alive personal religion must have been great.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class=

            Then, altogether apart from the social and semi-political
            propaganda of the Hussites, there is evidence that ever since the
            circulation of the encyclic letter addressed by the Taborites in
            November 1431 to all Christians in all lands, and more especially
            since the foundation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Unitas Fratrum</span></span> in 1452, there
            had been constant communication between Bohemia and the scattered
            bodies of evangelical dissenters throughout Germany. Probably
            historians have credited the Hussites with more than their due
            influence over their German sympathisers. The latter had arrived
            at the conclusion that tithes ought to be looked upon as
            free-will offerings, that the cup should be given to the laity,
            etc., long before the movements under the leadership of Wiclif
            and of Huss. But the knowledge that they had sympathisers and
            brethren beyond their own land must have been a source of
            strength to the German nonconformists.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our knowledge
            of the times is still too obscure to warrant us in making very
            definite statements about the proportionate effect of these three
            religious sources of influence on the small communities of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Brethren</span></span> or evangelical
            dissenters from the mediæval Church which <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id=
            "Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> maintained a precarious
            existence at the close of the Middle Ages. There is one curious
            fact, however, which shows that there must have been an intimate
            connection between the Waldenses of Savoy and France, the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Brethren</span></span> of Germany, and the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Unitas
            Fratrum</span></span> of Bohemia. They all used the same
            catechism for the instruction of their children in divine things.
            So far as can be ascertained, this small catechism was first
            printed in 1498, and editions can be traced down to 1530. It
            exists in French, Italian, German, and Bohemian. The inspiration
            drawn from the earlier Mystics and <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Gottesfreunde</span></span> is shown by the
            books circulated by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Brethren</span></span>. They made great use
            of the newly discovered art of printing to spread abroad small
            mystical writings on personal religion, and translations of
            portions of the Holy Scriptures. They printed and circulated
            books which had been used in manuscript among the Mystics of the
            fourteenth century, such as the celebrated <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Masterbook</span></span>, single sermons by
            Tauler, Prayers and Rules for holy living extracted from his
            writings, as well as short tracts taken from the later Mystics,
            like the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Explanation of the Ten
            Commandments</span></span>. It is also probable that some of the
            many translations of the whole or portions of the Bible which
            were in circulation in Germany before the days of Luther came
            from these praying circles. The celebrated firm of Nürnberg
            printers, the Koburgers, who published so many Bibles, were the
            German printers of the little catechism used by the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Brethren</span></span>; and, as has been
            said, the Anabaptists, who were the successors of these
            associations, did not use Luther's version, but a much older one
            which had come down to them from their ancestors.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The members of
            these praying circles welcomed the Lutheran Reformation when it
            came, but they can scarcely be said to have belonged to it.
            Luther has confessed how much he owed to one of their
            publications, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Die deutsche Theologie</span></span>; and
            what helped him must have benefited others. The organisation of a
            Lutheran Church, based on civil divisions of the Empire, gave the
            signal for a thorough reorganisation of the members of these old
            associations <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg
            156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            who refused to have anything to do with a State Church. They
            formed the best side of the very mixed and very much
            misunderstood movement which later was called Anabaptism, and
            thus remained outside of the two great divisions into which the
            Church of the Reformation separated. This religious type existed
            and showed itself more especially among the artisans in the
            larger towns of Germany.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must not be
            supposed that these four classes of religious sentiment which
            have been found existing during the later decades of the
            fifteenth and the early decades of the sixteenth centuries can
            always be clearly distinguished from each other. Religious types
            cannot be kept distinct, but continually blend with each other in
            the most unexpected way. Humanism and Anabaptism seem as far
            apart as they can possibly be; yet some of the most noted
            Anabaptist leaders were distinguished members of the Erasmus
            circle at Basel. Humanism and delicate clinging to the simple
            faith of childhood blended in the exquisite character of
            Melanchthon. Luther, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">after</span></em> his stern wrestle with
            self-righteousness in the convent at Erfurt, believed that, had
            his parents been dead, he could have delivered their souls from
            purgatory by his visits to the shrines of the saints at Rome. The
            boy Mecum (Myconius) retained only so much of his father's
            teaching about the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">free</span></em> Grace of God that he
            believed an Indulgence from Tetzel would benefit him if he could
            obtain it without paying for it. There is everywhere and at all
            times a blending of separate types of religious faith, until a
            notable crisis brings men suddenly face to face with the
            necessity of a choice. Such a crisis occurred during the period
            we call the Reformation, with the result that the leaders in that
            great religious revival found that the truest theology after all
            was what had expressed itself in hymns and prayers, in revivalist
            sermons and in fireside teaching, and that they felt it to be
            their duty as theologians to give articulate dogmatic expression
            to what their fathers had been content to find inarticulately in
            the devotional rather <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg
            157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            than in the intellectual sphere of the mediæval religious
            life.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such was the
            religious atmosphere into which Luther was born, and which he
            breathed from his earliest days. Every element seems to have
            shared in creating and shaping his religious history, and had
            similar effects doubtless on his most distinguished and
            sympathetic followers.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
            Italian Humanism seemed about to become a mere revival of ancient
            Paganism, with its accompaniments of a cynical sensualism on the
            one hand, and the blindest trust in the occult sciences on the
            other, a great preacher arose in Florence who recalled men to
            Christianity and to Christian virtue.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Girolamo
            Savonarola was an Italian, a countryman of Giaocchino di Fiore,
            of Arnold of Brescia, of Francis of Assisi, of John of Parma,
            and, like them, he believed himself to be favoured with visions
            apocalyptic and other. He belonged to a land over which, all down
            through the Middle Ages, had swept popular religious revivals,
            sudden, consuming, and transient as prairie fires. When a boy, he
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name=
            "Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> had quivered at
            seeing the pain in the world around him; he had shuddered as he
            passed the great grim palaces of the Italian despots, where the
            banqueting hall was separated from the dungeon by a floor so thin
            that the groans of the prisoners mingled with the tinkle of the
            silver dishes and the wanton conversation of the guests. He had
            been destined by his family for the medical profession, and the
            lad was set to master the writings of Thomas Aquinas and the
            Arabian commentaries on Aristotle—the gateway in those days to a
            knowledge of the art of healing. The <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Summa</span></span>
            of the great Schoolman entranced him, and insensibly drew him
            towards theology; but outwardly he did not rebel against the lot
            in life marked out for him. A glimpse of a quiet resting-place in
            this world of pain and evil had come to him, but it vanished,
            swallowed up in the universal gloom, when Roberto Strozzi refused
            to permit him to marry his daughter Laodamia. There remained only
            rest on God, study of His word, and such slight solace as music
            and sonnet-writing could bring. His devotion to Thomas Aquinas
            impelled him to seek within a Dominican convent that refuge which
            he passionately yearned for, from a corrupt world and a corrupt
            Church. There he remained buried for long years, reading and
            re-reading the Scriptures, poring over the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Summa</span></span>, drinking in the New
            Learning, almost unconsciously creating for himself a philosophy
            which blended the teachings of Aquinas with the Neo-Platonism of
            Marsiglio Ficino and of the Academy, and planning how he could
            best represent the doctrines of the Christian religion in harmony
            with the natural reason of man.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When at last
            he became a great preacher, able to sway heart and conscience, it
            should not be forgotten that he was mediæval to the core. His
            doctrinal teaching was based firmly on the theology of Thomas
            Aquinas. His intellectual conception of faith, his strong belief
            in the divine predestination and his way of expressing it, his
            view of Scripture as possessing manifold meanings, were all
            defined for him by the great Dominican Schoolman. <span class=

            "Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> He held strongly the mediæval
            idea that the Church was an external political unity, ruled by
            the Bishop of Rome, to whom every human soul must be subject, and
            whom everyone must obey save only when commands were issued
            contrary to a plain statement of the evangelical law. He
            expounded the fulness of and the slight limitations to the
            authority of the Pope exactly as Thomas and the great Schoolmen
            of the thirteenth century had done, though in terms very
            different from the canonists of the Roman Curia at the close of
            the Middle Ages. Even his appreciation of the Neo-Platonist side
            of Humanism could be traced back to mediæval authorities; for at
            all times the writings of the pseudo-Dionysius had been a source
            of inspiration to the greater Schoolmen.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His
            scholarship brought him into relation with the Humanist leaders
            in Florence, the earnest tone of his teaching and the saintliness
            of his character attracted them, his deep personal piety made
            them feel that he possessed something which they lacked; while no
            Neo-Platonist could be repelled by his claim to be the recipient
            of visions from on high.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The celebrated
            Humanists of Florence became the disciples of the great preacher.

            kept one lamp burning before the bust of Plato and another before
            an image of the Virgin, was for a time completely under his
            spell. Young Giovanni Pico della Mirandola's whole inner life was
            changed through his conversations with the Prior of San Marco. He
            reformed his earlier careless habits. He burnt five books of

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Italian
            Humanism was for the moment won over to Christianity by the Prior
            of San Marco. Had the poets and the scholars, the politicians and
            the ecclesiastics, the State and the Church, not been so
            hopelessly corrupt, there might have been a great renovation of
            mankind, under the leadership of men who had no desire to break
            the political unity of the mediæval Church. For it can scarcely
            be too strongly insisted that Savonarola was no Reformation
            leader in the more limited sense of the phrase. The movement he
            headed has much more affinity with the crude revival of religion
            in Germany in the end of the fifteenth century, than with the
            Reformation itself; and the aim of the reorganisation of the
            Tuscan congregation of the Dominicans under Savonarola has an
            almost exact parallel in the creation of the congregation of the
            Augustinian Eremites under Andreas Proles and Johann Staupitz.
            The whole Italian movement, as might be expected, was conducted
            by men of greater intelligence and refinement. It had therefore
            less sympathy than the German with pilgrimages, relics, the
            niceties of ceremonial worship, and the cult of the vulgarly
            miraculous; but it was not the less mediæval on these accounts.
            It was the death rather than the life and lifework of Savonarola
            that was destined to have direct effect on the Reformation soon
            to come beyond the Alps; for his martyrdom was a crowning
            evidence of the impossibility of reforming the Church of the
            Middle Ages apart from the shock of a great convulsion.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Luther himself,”</span> says Professor

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While
            Savonarola was at the height of his influence in Florence, there
            chanced to be in Italy a young Englishman, <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id=
            "Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> John Colet, son of a wealthy
            London merchant who had been several times Lord Mayor. He had
            gone there, we may presume, like his countrymen Grocyn and
            Linacre, to make himself acquainted with the New Learning at its
            fountainhead. There is no proof that he went to Florence or ever
            saw the great Italian preacher; but no stranger could have
            visited Northern Italy in 1495 without hearing much of him and of
            his work. Colet's whole future life in England bears evidence
            that he did receive a new impulse while he was in Italy, and that
            of such a kind as could have come only from Savonarola. What
            Erasmus tells us of his sojourn there amply confirms this. Colet
            gave himself up to the study of the Holy Scriptures; he read
            carefully those theologians of the ancient Church specially
            acceptable to the Neo-Platonist Christian Humanists; he studied
            the pseudo-Dionysius, Origen, and Jerome. What is more remarkable
            still in a foreign Humanist come to study in Italy, he read
            diligently such English classics as he could find in order to
            prepare himself for the work of preaching when he returned to
            England. The words of Erasmus imply that the impulse to do all
            this came to him when he was in Italy, and there was no one to
            impart it to him but the great Florentine.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Colet
            returned to England in 1496, he began to lecture at Oxford on the
            Epistles of St. Paul. His method of exposition, familiar enough
            after Calvin had introduced it into the Reformed Church, was then
            absolutely new, and proves that he was an original and
            independent thinker. His aim was to find out the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">personal</span></em> message which the
            writer (St. Paul) had sent to the Christians at Rome; and this
            led him to seek for every trace which revealed the personality of
            the Apostle to the Gentiles. It was equally imperative to know
            what were the surroundings of the men to whom the Epistle was
            addressed, and Colet studied Suetonius to find some indications
            of the environment of the Roman Christians. He had thus
            completely freed himself from the Scholastic habit of using the
            Scriptures as a mere collection of isolated texts to be employed
            in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name=
            "Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> proving doctrines
            or moral rules constructed or imposed by the Church, and it is
            therefore not surprising to find that he never lards his
            expositions with quotations from the Fathers. It is a still
            greater proof of his daring that he set aside the allegorising
            methods of the Schoolmen,—methods abundantly used by
            Savonarola,—and that he did so in spite of his devotion to the
            writings of the pseudo-Dionysius. He was the first to apply the
            critical methods of the New Learning to discover the exact
            meaning of the books of the Holy Scriptures. His treatment of the
            Scriptures shows that however he may have been influenced by
            Savonarola and by the Christian Humanists of Italy, he had
            advanced far beyond them, and had seen, what no mediæval
            theologian head been able to perceive, that the Bible is a
            personal and not a dogmatic revelation. They were mediæval: he
            belongs to the Reformation circle of thinkers. Luther, Calvin,
            and Colet, whatever else separates them, have this one deeply
            important thought in common. Further, Colet discarded the
            mediæval conception of a mechanical inspiration of the text of
            Scripture, in this also agreeing with Luther and Calvin. The
            inspiration of the Holy Scriptures was something mysterious to
            him. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Spirit seemed to him by reason
            of its majesty to have a peculiar method of its own, singularly,
            absolutely free, blowing where it lists, making prophets of whom
            it will, yet so that the spirit of the prophets is subject to the
            prophets.”</span><a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Colet saw
            clearly, and denounced the abounding evils which were ruining the
            Church of his day. The Convocation of the English Church never
            listened to a bolder <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg
            166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            sermon than that preached to them by the Dean of St. Paul's in
            1512—the same year that Luther addressed an assembly of clergy at
            Leitzkau. The two addresses should be compared. The same
            fundamental thought is contained in both—that every true
            reformation must begin with the individual man. Colet declared
            that reform must begin with the bishops, and that once begun it
            would spread to the clergy and thence to the laity; <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“for the body follows the soul; and as are the rulers
            in a State, such will the people be.”</span> He urged that what
            was wanted was the enforcement of ecclesiastical laws which were
            already in existence. Ignorant and wicked men were admitted to
            holy orders, and there were laws prohibiting this. Simony was
            creeping <span class="tei tei-q">“like a cancer through the minds
            of priests, so that most are not ashamed in these days to get for
            themselves great dignities by petitions and suits at court,
            rewards and promises”</span>; and yet strict laws against the
            evil were in existence. He proceeded to enumerate the other
            flagrant abuses—the non-residence of clergy, the worldly pursuits
            and indulgences of the clergy; the scandals and vices of the
            ecclesiastical law-courts; the infrequency of provincial councils
            to discuss and remedy existing evils; the wasting of the
            patrimony of the Church on sumptuous buildings, on banquets, on
            enriching kinsfolk, or on keeping hounds. The Church had laws
            against all these abuses, but they were not enforced, and could
            not be until the bishops amended their ways. His scheme of reform
            was to put in operation the existing regulations of Canon Law.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The diseases which are now in the Church
            were the same in former ages, and there is no evil for which the
            holy fathers did not provide excellent remedies; there are no
            crimes in prohibition of which there are not laws in the body of
            Canon Law.”</span> Such was his definite idea of reform in this
            famous Convocation sermon.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But he had
            wider views. He desired the diffusion of a sound Christian
            education, and did the best that could be done by one man to
            promote it, by spending his private fortune in founding St.
            Paul's school, which he characteristically <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id=
            "Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> left in charge of a body of
            laymen. He longed to see a widespread preaching in the
            vernacular, and believed that the bishops should show an example
            in this clerical duty. It is probable that he wished the whole
            service to be in the vernacular, for it was made a charge against
            him that he taught his congregation to repeat the Lord's Prayer
            in English. Besides, he had clearly grasped the thought, too
            often forgotten by theologians of all schools, that the spiritual
            facts and forces which lie at the roots of the Christian life are
            one thing, and the intellectual conceptions which men make to
            explain these facts and forces are another, and a much less
            important thing; that men are able to be Christians and to live
            the Christian life because of the former and not because of the
            latter. He saw that, while dogma has its place, it is at best the
            alliance of an immortal with a mortal, the union between that
            which is unchangeably divine and the fashions of human thought
            which change from one age to another. For this reason he thought
            little of the Scholastic Theology of his days, with its
            forty-three propositions about the nature of God and its
            forty-five about the nature of man before and after the Fall,
            each of which had to be assented to at the risk of a charge of
            heresy. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why do you extol to me such a
            man as Aquinas? If he had not been so very arrogant, indeed, he
            would not surely so rashly and proudly have taken upon himself to
            define all things. And unless his spirit had been somewhat
            worldly, he would not surely have corrupted the whole teaching of
            Christ by mixing it with his profane philosophy.”</span> The
            Scholastic Theology might have been scientific in the thirteenth
            century, but the <span class="tei tei-q">“scientific”</span> is
            the human and changing element in dogma, and the old theology had
            become clearly unscientific in the sixteenth. Therefore he was
            accustomed to advise young theological students to keep to the
            Bible and the Apostles' Creed, and let divines, if they liked,
            dispute about the rest; and he taught Erasmus to look askance at
            Luther's reconstruction of the Augustinian theology.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But no
            thinking man, however he may flout at philosophy <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id=
            "Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and dogma, can do without
            either; and Colet was no exception to the general rule. He has
            placed on record his detestation of Aquinas and his dislike of
            Augustine, and we may perhaps see in this a lack of sympathy with
            a prominent characteristic of the theology of Latin Christianity
            from Tertullian to Aquinas and Occam, to say nothing of
            developments since the Reformation. The great men who built up
            the Western Church were almost all trained Roman lawyers.
            Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine, Gregory the Great (whose writings
            form the bridge between the Latin Fathers and the Schoolmen) were
            all men whose early training had been that of a Roman lawyer,—a
            training which moulded and shaped all their thinking, whether
            theological or ecclesiastical. They instinctively regarded all
            questions as a great Roman lawyer would. They had the lawyer's
            craving for exact definitions. They had the lawyer's idea that
            the primary duty laid upon them was to enforce obedience to
            authority, whether that authority expressed itself in external
            institutions or in the precise definitions of the correct ways of
            thinking about spiritual truths. No branch of Western Christendom
            has been able to free itself from the spell cast upon it by these
            Roman lawyers of the early centuries of the Christian Church.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the ideas
            of Christian Roman lawyers, filtering slowly down through the
            centuries, had made the Bishops of Rome dream that they were the
            successors of Augustus, at once Emperor and Pontifex Maximus,
            master of the bodies and of the souls of mankind, they had also
            inspired the theologians of the Mediæval Church with the
            conception of an intellectual imperialism, where a system of
            Christian thought, expressed with legal precision, could bind
            into a comprehensive unity the active intelligence of mankind.
            Dogmas thus expressed can become the instruments of a tyranny
            much more penetrating than that of an institution, and so Colet
            found. In his revolt he turned from the Latins to the Greeks, and
            to that thinker who was furthest removed from the legal precision
            of statement which was characteristic of Western
            theology.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg
            169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
            that his intercourse with the Christian Humanists of Italy, and
            his introduction to Platonists and to Neo-Platonism, made him
            turn to the writings of the pseudo-Dionysius; but it is certain
            that he believed at first that the author of these quaint
            mystical tracts was the Dionysius who was one of the converts of
            St. Paul at Athens, and that these writings embodied much of the
            teaching of the Apostle to the Gentiles, and took the reader back
            to the first generation of the Christian Church. After he had
            learned from Grocyn that the author of the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Celestial</span></span> and the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Terrestrial
            Hierarchies</span></span> could not have been the convert of St.
            Paul, and that the writings could not be earlier than the sixth
            century, he still regarded them as evidence of the way in which a
            Christian philosopher could express the thoughts which were
            current in Christianity one thousand years before Colet's time.
            The writings could be used as a touchstone to test usages and
            opinions prevalent at the close of the Middle Ages, when men were
            still subject to the domination of the Scholastic Theology, and
            as justification for rejecting them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They taught
            him two things which he was very willing to learn: that the human
            mind, however it may be able to feel after God, can never
            comprehend Him, nor imprison His character and attributes in
            propositions—stereotyped aspects of thoughts—which can be fitted
            into syllogisms; and that such things as hierarchy and sacraments
            are to be prized not because they are in themselves the active
            sources and centres of mysterious powers, but because they
            faintly symbolise the spiritual forces by which God works for the
            salvation of His people. Colet applied to the study of the
            writings of the pseudo-Dionysius a mind saturated with simple
            Christian truth gained from a study of the Holy Scriptures, and
            especially of the Epistles of St. Paul; and the very luxuriance
            of imagination and bewildering confusion of symbolism in these
            writings, their elusiveness as opposed to the precision of Thomas
            Aquinas or of John Duns the Scot, enabled him the more easily to
            find in them the germs of his own more definite
            opinions.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg

            Colet wrote out from memory—with the actual text of the books
            themselves, it is scarcely surprising to find how much there is
            of Colet and how little of Dionysius.<a id="noteref_119" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While it is
            impossible to say how far Colet, and the Christian Humanists who
            agreed with him, would have welcomed the principles of a
            Reformation yet to come, it can be affirmed that he held the same
            views on two very important points. He did not believe in a
            priesthood in the mediæval nor in the modern Roman sense of the
            word, and his theory of the efficacy and meaning of the
            sacraments of the Christian Church was essentially
            Protestant.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
            Colet, there was no such thing as a mediatorial priesthood whose
            essential function it was to approach God on men's behalf and
            present their offerings to Him. The duty of the Christian
            priesthood was ministerial; it was to declare the love and mercy
            of God to their fellow-men, and to strive for the purification,
            illumination, and salvation of mankind by constant preaching of
            the truth and diffusion of gospel light, even as Christ strove.
            He did not believe that priests had received from God the power
            of absolving from sins. <span class="tei tei-q">“It must be
            needfully remarked,”</span> he says, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“lest bishops be presumptuous, that it is not the
            part of men to loose the bonds of sins; nor does the power belong
            to them of loosing or binding anything,”</span>—the truth Luther
            set forth in his Theses against Indulgences.</p><span class=

            "Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Colet is even
            more decided in his repudiation of the sacramental theories of
            the mediæval Church. The Eucharist is not a sacrifice, but a
            commemoration of the death of our Lord, and a symbol of the union
            and communion which believers have with Him, and with their
            fellow-men through Him. Baptism is a ceremony which symbolises
            the believer's change of heart and his vow of service to his
            Master, and signifies <span class="tei tei-q">“the more excellent
            baptism of the inner man”</span>; and the duty of sponsors is to
            train children in the knowledge and fear of God.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are told
            that the Lollards delighted in Colet's preaching; that they
            advised each other to go to hear him; and that attendance at the
            Dean's sermons was actually made a charge against them. Colet was
            no Lollard himself; indeed, he seems to have once sat among
            ecclesiastical judges who condemned Lollards to death;<a id=
            "noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a> but
            the preacher who taught that tithes were voluntary offerings, who
            denounced the evil lives of the monks and the secular clergy; who
            hated war, and did not scruple to say so; whose sermons were full
            of simple Bible instruction, must have recalled many memories of
            the old Lollard doctrines. For Lollardy had never died out in
            England: it was active in Colet's days, leavening the country for
            the Reformation which was to come.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor should it
            be forgotten, in measuring the influence of Colet on the coming
            Reformation, that Latimer was a friend of his, that William
            Tyndale was one of his favourite pupils, and that he persuaded
            Erasmus to turn from purely classical studies to edit the New
            Testament and the early Christian Fathers.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Erasmus, as
            has often been said, was a <span class="tei tei-q">“man by
            himself;”</span> yet he may be regarded as representing one, and
            perhaps the most frequent, type of Christian Humanism. His
            character will always be matter of controversy; and his motives
            may, without unfairness, be represented in an unfavourable
            light,—a <span class="tei tei-q">“great scholar but a
            petty-minded man,”</span> is a verdict for which there is
            abundant evidence. Such was the final judgment of his
            contemporaries, mainly because he refused to take a definite side
            in the age when the greatest controversy which has convulsed
            Western Europe since the downfall of the old Empire seemed to
            call on every man to range himself with one party or other. Our
            modern judgment must rest on a different basis. In calmer days,
            when the din of battle has almost died away, it is possible to
            recognise that to refuse to be a partisan <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></em>
            indicate greatness instead of littleness of soul, a keener
            vision, and a calmer courage. We cannot judge the man as hastily
            as his contemporaries did. Still there is evidence enough and to
            spare to back their verdict. Every biographer has admitted that
            it is hopeless to look for truth in his voluminous
            correspondence. His feelings, hopes, intentions, and actual
            circumstances are described to different correspondents at the
            same time in utterly different ways. He was always writing for
            effect, and often for effect of a rather sordid kind. He seldom
            gave a definite opinion on any important question without
            attempting to qualify it in such a manner that he might be able,

            responsibility. He had the ingenuity of the cuttle-fish to
            conceal himself and his real opinions, and it was commonly used
            to protect his own skin. All this may be admitted; it can
            scarcely be denied.</p>

            own conception of what a reformation of Christianity really
            meant, and what share in it it was possible for him to take. It
            must be admitted that he held to this idea and kept to the path
            he had marked out for himself with a tenacity of purpose which
            did him honour. It was by no means always that of personal
            safety, still less the road to personal aggrandisement. It led
            him in the end where he had never expected to stand. It made him
            a man despised by both sides in the great controversy; it left
            him absolutely alone, friendless, and without influence. He
            frequently used very contemptible means to ward off attempts to
            make him diverge to the right or left; he abandoned many of his
            earlier principles, or so modified them that they were no longer
            recognisable. But he was always true to his own idea of a
            reformation and of his life-work as a reformer.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Erasmus was
            firmly convinced that Christianity was above all things something
            practical. It had to do with the ordinary life of mankind. It
            meant love, humility, purity, reverence,—every virtue which the
            Saviour had made manifest in His life on earth. This early
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian philosophy”</span> had been
            buried out of sight under a Scholastic Theology full of
            sophistical subtleties, and had been lost in the mingled Judaism
            and Paganism of the popular religious life, with its weary
            ceremonies and barbarous usages. A true reformation, he believed,
            was the moral renovation of mankind, and the one need of the age
            was to return to that earlier purer religion based on a real
            inward reverence for and imitation of Christ. The man of letters,
            like himself, he conceived could play the part of a reformer, and
            that manfully, in two ways. He could try, by the use of wit and
            satire, to make contemptible the follies of the Schoolmen and the
            vulgar travesty of religion which was in vogue among the people.
            He could also bring before the eyes of all men that earlier and
            purer religion which was true Christianity. He could edit the New
            Testament, and enable men to read the very words which Jesus
            spoke and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg

            apostolic explanations of their meaning. He could say:</p>

            teachable, and you have already made much way in this (the
            Christian) Philosophy. It supplies a spirit for a teacher,
            imparted to none more readily than to the simple-minded. Other
            philosophies, by the very difficulty of their precepts, are
            removed out of the range of most minds. No age, no sex, no
            condition of life is excluded from this. The sun itself is not
            more common and open to all than the teaching of Christ. For I
            utterly dissent from those who are unwilling that the Sacred
            Scriptures should be read by the unlearned translated into their
            vulgar tongue, as though Christ had taught such subtleties that
            they can scarcely be understood even by a few theologians, or as
            though the strength of the Christian religion consisted in men's
            ignorance of it. The mysteries of kings it may be safer to
            conceal, but Christ wished His mysteries to be published as
            openly as possible. I wish that even the weakest woman should
            read the Gospel—should read the Epistles of Paul. And I wish
            these were translated into all languages, so that they might be
            read and understood, not only by Scots and Irishmen, but also by
            Turks and Saracens. To make them understood is surely the first
            step. It may be that they might be ridiculed by many, but some
            would take them to heart. I long that the husbandman should sing
            portions of them to himself as he follows the plough, that the
            weaver should hum them to the tune of his shuttle, that the
            traveller should beguile with their stories the tedium of his
            journey.</span><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The scholar
            who became a reformer could further make plain, by editing and
            publishing the writings of the earlier Christian Fathers, what
            the oldest Christian Theology had been before the Schoolmen
            spoiled it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conception
            that a reformation of Christianity was mainly a renovation of
            morals, enabled the Christian Humanist to keep true to the
            Renaissance idea that the writers of classical antiquity were to
            be used to aid the work of ameliorating the lot of mankind. The
            Florentine circle spoke of the inspiration of Homer, of Plato,
            and of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg
            175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            Cicero, and saw them labouring as our Lord had done to teach men
            how to live better lives. Pico and Reuchlin had gone further
            afield, and had found illuminating anticipations of Christianity,
            in this sense and in others, among the Hebrews, the Egyptians,
            and perhaps the Brahmins. Erasmus was too clear-sighted to be
            drawn into any alliance with Oriental mysticism or cabalistic
            speculations; but he insisted on the aid which would come from
            the Christian reformer making full use of the ethical teaching of
            the wise men of Greece and Rome in his attempt to produce a moral
            renovation in the lives of his fellows. Socrates and Cicero, each
            in his own day and within his own sphere, had striven for the
            same moral renovation that Christianity promised, and, in this
            sense at least, might be called Christians before Christ. So
            persuaded was Erasmus of their affinity with the true spirit of
            Christianity, that he declared that Cicero had as much right to a
            high place in heaven as many a Christian saint, and that when he
            thought of the Athenian martyr he could scarcely refrain from
            saying, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Sancte Socrates, Ora pro
            nobis</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must be
            remembered also that Erasmus had a genuine and noble horror of
            war, which was by no means the mere shrinking of a man whose
            nerves were always quivering. He preached peace as boldly and in
            as disinterested a fashion as did his friend John Colet. He could
            not bear the thought of a religious war. This must not be
            forgotten in any estimate of his conduct and of his relation to
            the Reformation. No man, not even Luther, scattered the seeds of
            revolution with a more reckless hand, and yet a thorough and
            steadfast dislike to all movements which could be called
            revolutionary was one of the most abiding elements in his
            character. He hated what he called the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“tumult.”</span> He had an honest belief that all
            public evils in State and Church must be endured until they
            dissolve away quietly under the influence of sarcasm and common
            sense, or until they are removed by the action of the responsible
            authorities. He was clear-sighted enough to see that an open and
            avowed attack on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg
            176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            papal supremacy, or on any of the more cherished doctrines and
            usages of the mediæval Church, must end in strife and in
            bloodshed, and he therefore honestly believed that no such attack
            ought to be made.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When all these
            things are kept in view, it is possible to see what conception
            Erasmus had about his work as a reformer, with its possibilities
            and its limitations. He adhered to it tenaciously all his life.
            He held it in the days of his earlier comparative obscurity. He
            maintained it when he had been enthroned as the prince of the
            realm of learning. He clung to it in his discredited old age. No
            one can justify the means he sometimes took to prevent being
            drawn from the path he had marked out for himself; but there is
            something to be said for the man who, through good report and
            evil, stuck resolutely to his view of what a reformation ought to
            be, and what were the functions of a man of letters who felt
            himself called to be a reformer. Had Luther been gifted with that
            keen sense of prevision with which Erasmus was so fatally
            endowed, would he have stood forward to attack Indulgences in the
            way he did? It is probable that it would have made no difference
            in his action; but he did not think so himself. He said once,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“No good work comes about by our own
            wisdom; it begins in dire necessity. I was forced into mine; but
            had I known then what I know now, ten wild horses would not have
            drawn me into it.”</span> The man who leads a great movement of
            reform may see the distant, but has seldom a clear vision of the
            nearer future. He is one who feels the slow pressure of an
            imperious spiritual power, who is content with one step at a
            time, and who does not ask to see the whole path stretching out
            before him.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Erasmus lost
            both his parents while he was a child, and never enjoyed the
            advantages of a home training. He was driven by deceit or by
            self-deception into a monastery when he was a lad. He escaped
            from the clutches of the monastic life when he was twenty years
            of age, broken in health, and having learned to know human nature
            on its bad side and to trade on that knowledge. He was one of
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name=
            "Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the loneliest of
            mortals, and trusted in no one but himself. With one great
            exception, he had no friendship which left an enduring influence
            on his character. From childhood he taught himself in his own
            way; when he grew to manhood he planned and schemed for himself;
            he steadfastly refused to be drawn into any kind of work which he
            did not like for its own sake; he persistently shunned every
            entanglement which might have controlled his action or weighted
            him with any responsibility. He stands almost alone among the
            Humanists in this. All the others were officials, or professors,
            or private teachers, or jurists, or ecclesiastics. Erasmus was
            nothing, and would be nothing, but a simple man of letters.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Holbein has
            painted him so often that his features are familiar. Every line
            of the clearly cut face suggests demure sarcasm—the thin lips
            closely pressed together, the half-closed eyelids, and the keen
            glance of the scarcely seen blue eyes. The head is intellectual,
            but there is nothing masculine about the portrait—nothing
            suggesting the massiveness of the learned burgher Pirkheimer; or
            the jovial strength of the Humanist <span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">landsknecht</span></span> Eobanus Hessus; or
            the lean wolf-like tenacity of Hutten, the descendant of
            robber-knights; or the steadfast homely courage of Martin Luther.
            The dainty hands, which Holbein drew so often, and the general
            primness of his appearance, suggest a descent from a long line of
            maiden aunts. The keen intelligence was enclosed in a sickly
            body, whose frailty made continuous demands on the soul it
            imprisoned. It needed warm rooms with stoves that sent forth no
            smell, the best wines, an easy-going horse, and a deft servant;
            and to procure all these comforts Erasmus wrote the sturdiest of
            begging letters and stooped to all kinds of flatteries.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The visit
            which Erasmus paid to England in 1498 was the turning-point in
            his life. He found himself, for the first time, among men who
            were his equals in learning and his superiors in many things.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“When I listen to my friend
            Colet,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“it seems to me
            like listening to Plato <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg
            178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            himself. Who does not marvel at the complete mastery of the
            sciences in Grocyn? What could be keener, more profound, and more
            searching than the judgment of Linacre? Has Nature ever made a
            more gentle, a sweeter, or a happier disposition than Thomas
            More's?”</span> He made the acquaintance of men as full of the
            New Learning as he was himself, who hated the Scotist theology
            more bitterly than he did, and who nevertheless believed in a
            pure, simple Christian philosophy, and were earnest Christians.
            They urged him to join them in their work, and we can trace in
            the correspondence of Erasmus the growing influence of Colet. The
            Dean of St. Paul's made Erasmus the decidedly Christian Humanist
            he became, and impressed on him that conception of a reformation
            which, leaving external things very much as they were, undertook
            a renovation of morals. He never lost the impress of Colet's
            stamp.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would
            appear from one of Erasmus' letters that Colet urged him to write
            commentaries on some portions of the New Testament; but Erasmus
            would only work in his own way; and it is probable that his
            thoughts were soon turned to preparing an edition of the New
            Testament in Greek. The task was long brooded over; and he had to
            perfect himself in his knowledge of the language.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
            determination to undertake no work for which he was not supremely
            fitted, together with his powers of application and acquisition,
            gave Erasmus the reputation of being a strong man. He was seen to
            be unlike any other Humanist, whether Italian or German. He had
            no desire merely to reproduce the antique, or to confine himself
            within the narrow circle in which the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Poets”</span> of the Renaissance worked. He put
            ancient culture to modern uses. Erasmus was no arm-chair student.
            He was one of the keenest observers of everything human—the
            Lucian or the Voltaire of the sixteenth century. From under his
            half-closed eyelids his quick glance seized and retained the
            salient characteristics of all sorts and conditions of men and
            women. He described theologians, jurists and philosophers, monks
            and parish priests, merchants and soldiers, <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id=
            "Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> husbands and wives, women
            good and bad, dancers and diners, pilgrims, pardon-sellers, and
            keepers of relics; the peasant in the field, the artisan in the
            workshop, and the vagrant on the highway. He had studied all, and
            could describe them with a few deft phrases, as incisive as
            Dürer's strokes, with an almost perfect style, and with easy
            sarcasm.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
            application of the New Learning to portray the common life,
            combined with his profound learning, made Erasmus the idol of the
            young German Humanists. They said that he was more than mortal,
            that his judgment was infallible, and that his work was perfect.
            They made pilgrimages to visit him. An interview was an event to
            be talked about for years; a letter, a precious treasure to be
            bequeathed as an heirloom. Some men refused to render the
            universal homage accorded by scholars and statesmen, by princes
            lay and clerical. Luther scented Pelagian theology in his
            annotations; he scorned Erasmus' wilful playing with truth; he
            said that the great Humanist was a mocker who poured ridicule
            upon everything, even on Christ and religion. There was some
            ground for the charge. His sarcasm was not confined to his
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Praise
            of Folly</span></span> or to his <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Colloquies</span></span>. It appears in
            almost everything that he wrote—even in his Paraphrases of the
            New Testament.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That such a
            man should have felt himself called upon to be a reformer, that
            this Saul should have appeared among the prophets, is in itself
            testimony that he lived during a great religious crisis, and that
            the religious question was the most important one in his
            days.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The principal
            literary works of Erasmus meant to serve the reformation he
            desired to see are:—two small books, <span class=

            religion consists in ceremonies and in more than Jewish

            whole aim of the book is to assert the individual responsibility
            of man to God apart from any intermediate human agency. Erasmus
            ignores as completely as Luther would have done the whole
            mediæval thought of the mediatorial function of the Church and
            its priestly order. In this respect the book is essentially
            Protestant and thoroughly revolutionary. It asserts in so many

            evident it becomes that Erasmus did not intend to write a satire
            on human weakness in general: the book is the most severe attack
            on the mediæval Church that had, up to that time, been made; and
            it was meant to be so. The author wanders from his main theme
            occasionally, but always to return to the insane follies of the
            religious life sanctioned by the highest authorities of the
            mediæval Church. Popes, bishops, theologians, monks, and the
            ordinary lay Christians, are all unmitigated fools in their
            ordinary religious life. The style is vivid, the author has seen
            what he describes, and he makes his readers see it also. He
            writes with a mixture of light mockery and bitter earnestness. He
            exposes the foolish questions of the theologians; the vices and
            temporal ambitions of the Popes, bishops, and monks; the stupid
            trust in festivals, pilgrimages, indulgences, and relics. The
            theologians, the author says, are rather dangerous people to
            attack, for they come down on one with their six hundred
            conclusions and command him to recant, and if he does not they
            declare him a heretic forthwith. The problems which interest them

            such a way that he may begin over again with a new circle of
            crimes? The reverence for relics was perhaps never so cruelly
            satirised as in the Colloquy, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Peregrinatio
            Religionis Ergo</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must be
            remembered that this bitter satire was written some years before
            Luther began the Reformation by an attack on Indulgences. It may
            seem surprising how much liberty the satirist allowed himself,
            and how much was permitted to him. But Erasmus knew very well how
            to protect himself. He was very careful to make no definite
            attack, and to make no mention of names. He was always ready to
            explain that he did not mean to attack the Papacy, but only bad
            Popes; that he had the highest respect for the monastic life, and
            only satirised evil-minded monks; or that he reverenced the
            saints, but thought that reverence ought to be shown by imitating
            them in their lives of piety. He could say all this with perfect
            truth. Indeed, it is likely that with all his scorn against the
            monks, Erasmus, in his heart, believed that a devout Capuchin or
            Franciscan monk lived the ideal Christian life. He seems to say
            so in his Colloquy, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Militis et Carthusiani</span></span>. He
            wrote, moreover, before the dignitaries of the mediæval Church
            had begun to take alarm. Liberal Churchmen who were the patrons
            of the New Learning had no objection to see the vices of the
            times and the Church life of the day satirised by one who wrote
            such exquisite latinity. In all his more serious work Erasmus was
            careful to shelter himself under the protection of great
            ecclesiastics.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Erasmus was
            not the only scholar who had proposed to publish a correct
            edition of the Holy Scriptures. The great Spaniard, Cardinal
            Ximenes, had announced that he meant to bring out an edition of
            the Holy Scriptures in which the text of the Vulgate would appear
            in parallel columns along with the Hebrew and the Greek. The

            finished in 1517, and was published in Spain in 1520 and in other
            lands in 1522. Erasmus was careful to dedicate the first edition

            St. Peter, young Humanist kings ruled France and England, the
            Emperor Maximilian had long been the patron of German Humanism,
            and much was expected from his grandson Charles, the young King
            of Spain. Erasmus, the acknowledged prince of Christian learning,
            was enthusiastically supported by Colet and More in England, by
            Buddæus and Lefèvre in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg
            185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            France, by Johann Staupitz, Cochlæus, Thomas Murner, Jerome
            Emser, Conrad Mutianus, and George Spalatin in Germany. They all
            believed that the golden age was approaching, when the secular
            princes would forbid wars, and the ecclesiastical lay aside their
            rapacity, and when both would lead the peoples of Europe in a
            reformation of morals and in a re-establishment of pure religion.
            Their hopes were high that all would be effected without the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“tumult”</span> which they all dreaded,
            and when the storm burst, many of them became bitter opponents of
            Luther and his action. Luther found no deadlier enemies than
            Thomas Murner and Jerome Emser. Others, like George Spalatin,
            became his warmest supporters. Erasmus maintained to the end his
            attitude of cautious neutrality. In a long letter to Marlianus,
            Bishop of Tuy in Spain, he says that he does not like Luther's
            writings, that he feared from the first that they would create a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“tumult,”</span> but that he dare not
            altogether oppose the reformer, <span class="tei tei-q">“because
            he feared that he might be fighting against God.”</span> The
            utmost that he could be brought to do after the strongest
            persuasions, was to attack Luther's Augustinian theology in his
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
            Libero Arbitrio</span></span>, and to insinuate a defence of the
            principle of ecclesiastical authority in the interpretation of
            Scripture, and a proof that Luther had laid too much stress on
            the element of <span class="tei tei-q">“grace”</span> in human
            actions. He turned away from the whole movement as far as he
            possibly could, protesting that for himself he would ever cling
            to the Roman See.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last years
            of his life were spent in excessive literary work—in editing the
            earlier Christian Fathers; he completed his edition of Origen in
            1536, the year of his death. He settled at Louvain, and found it
            too hotly theological for his comfort; went to Basel; wandered
            off to Freiburg; then went back to Basel to die. After his death
            he was compelled to take the side he had so long shrunk from.
            Pope Paul <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">iv.</span></span> classed him as a
            notorious heretic, and placed on the first papal <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Index”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“all his
            commentaries, notes, scholia, dialogues, letters, translations,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name=
            "Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> books, and
            writings, even when they contain nothing against religion or
            about religion.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We look in
            vain for any indication that those Christian Humanists perceived
            that they were actually living in a time of revolution, and were
            really standing on the edge of a crater which was about to change
            European history by its eruption. Sir Thomas More's instincts of
            religious life were all mediæval. Colet had persuaded him to
            abandon his earlier impulse to enter a monastic order, but More
            wore a hair shirt next his skin till the day of his death. Yet in
            his sketch of an ideal commonwealth, he expanded St. Paul's
            thought of the equality of all men before Christ into the
            conception that no man was to be asked to work more than six
            hours a day, and showed that religious freedom could only
            flourish where there was nothing in the form of the mediæval
            Church. The lovable and pious young Englishman never imagined
            that his academic dream would be translated into rude practical
            thoughts and ruder actions by leaders of peasant and artisan
            insurgents, and that his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Utopia</span></span> (1515), within ten
            years after its publication, and ten years before his own death
            (1535), would furnish texts for communist sermons, preached in
            obscure public-houses or to excited audiences on village greens.
            The satirical criticisms of the hierarchy, the monastic orders,
            and the popular religious life, which Erasmus flung broadcast so
            recklessly in his lighter and more serious writings, furnished
            the weapons for the leaders in that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“tumult”</span> which he had dreaded all his days;
            and when he complained that few seemed to care for the picture of
            a truly pious life, given in his <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Enchiridion</span></span>, he did not
            foresee that it would become a wonderfully popular book among
            those who renounced all connection with the See of Rome to which
            the author had promised a life-long obedience. The Christian
            Humanists, one and all, were strangely blind to the signs of the
            times in which they lived.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No one can
            fail to appreciate the nobility of the purpose to work for a
            great moral renovation of mankind <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> which the Christian Humanists ever kept
            before them, or refuse to see that they were always and
            everywhere preachers of righteousness. When we remember the
            century and a half of wars, so largely excited by ecclesiastical
            motives, which desolated Europe during the sixteenth and
            seventeenth centuries, few can withhold their sympathy from the
            Christian Humanist idea that the path of reformation lay through
            a great readjustment of the existing conditions of the religious
            life, rather than through ecclesiastical revolution to a
            thorough-going reconstruction; although we may sadly recognise
            that the dynastic struggles of secular princes, the rapacity and
            religious impotence of Popes and ecclesiastical authorities, and
            the imperious pressure of social and industrial discontent, made
            the path of peace impossible. But what must fill us with surprise
            is that the Christian Humanists seemed to believe with a
            childlike innocence that the constituted authorities, secular and
            ecclesiastical, would lead the way in this peaceful reform,
            mainly because they were tinged with Humanist culture, and were
            the patrons of artists and men of learning. Humanism meant to
            Pope Leo <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">x.</span></span> and to the young
            Archbishop of Mainz additional sources of enjoyment, represented
            by costly pictures, collections of MSS., and rare books, the
            gratification of their taste for jewels and cameos, to say
            nothing of less harmless indulgences, and the adulation of the
            circle of scholars whom they had attracted to their courts; and
            it meant little more to the younger secular princes.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is also to
            be feared that the Christian Humanists had no real sense of what
            was needed for that renovation of morals, public and private,
            which they ardently desired to see. Pictures of a Christian life
            lived according to the principles of reason, sharp polemic
            against the hierarchy, and biting mockery of the stupidity of the
            popular religion, did not help the masses of the people. The
            multitude in those early decades of the sixteenth century were
            scourged by constant visitations of the plague and other new and
            strange diseases, and they lived in perpetual dread of a
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name=
            "Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Turkish invasion.
            The fear of death and the judgment thereafter was always before
            their eyes. What they wanted was a sense of God's forgiveness for
            their sins, and they greedily seized on Indulgences, pilgrimages
            to holy places, and relic-worship to secure the pardon they
            longed for. The aristocratic and intellectual reform,
            contemplated by the Christian Humanists, scarcely appealed to
            them. Their longing for a certainty of salvation could not be
            satisfied with recommendations to virtuous living according to
            the rules of Neo-Platonic ethics. It is pathetic to listen to the
            appeals made to Erasmus for something more than he could ever
            give:</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Reformation
            had been attempted in various ways. Learned ecclesiastical
            Jurists had sought to bring it about in the fifteenth century by
            what was called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Conciliar Reform</span></span>. <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id=
            "Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The sincerity and ability of
            the leaders of the movement are unquestioned; but they had failed
            ignominiously, and the Papacy with all its abuses had never been
            so powerful ecclesiastically as when its superior diplomacy had
            vanquished the endeavour to hold it in tutelage to a council.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Christian
            Humanists had made their attempt—preaching a moral renovation and
            the application of the existing laws of the Church to punish
            ecclesiastical wrong-doers. Colet eloquently assured the Anglican
            Convocation that the Church possessed laws which, if only
            enforced, contained provisions ample enough to curb and master
            the ills which all felt to be rampant. Erasmus had held up to
            scorn the debased religious life of the times, and had denounced
            its Judaism and Paganism. Both were men of scholarship and
            genius; but they had never been able to move society to its
            depths, and awaken a new religious life, which was the one thing
            needful.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">History knows
            nothing of revivals of moral living apart from some new religious
            impulse. The motive power needed has always come through leaders
            who have had communion with the unseen. Humanism had supplied a
            superfluity of teachers; the times needed a prophet. They
            received one; a man of the people; bone of their bone, and flesh
            of their flesh; one who had himself lived that popular religious
            life with all the thoroughness of a strong, earnest nature, who
            had sounded all its depths and tested its capacities, and gained
            in the end no relief for his <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> burdened conscience; who had at last found
            his way into the presence of God, and who knew, by his own
            personal experience, that the living God was accessible to every
            Christian. He had won the freedom of a Christian man, and had
            reached through faith a joy in living far deeper than that which
            Humanism boasted. He became a leader of men, because his joyous
            faith made him a hero by delivering him from all fear of Church
            or of clergy—the fear which had weighed down the consciences of
            men for generations. Men could <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></em>
            what faith was when they looked at Luther.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must never
            be forgotten that to his contemporaries Luther was the embodiment
            of personal piety. All spoke of his sensitiveness to religious
            impressions of all kinds in his early years. While he was inside
            the convent, whether before or after he had found deliverance for
            his troubles of soul, his fellows regarded him as a model of
            piety. In later days, when he stood forth as a Reformer, he
            became such a power in the hearts of men of all sorts and ranks,
            because he was seen to be a thoroughly pious man. Albert Dürer
            may be taken as a type. In the great painter's diary of the
            journey he made with his wife and her maid Susanna to the
            Netherlands (1520),—a mere summary of the places he visited and
            the persons he saw, of what he paid for food and lodging and
            travel, of the prices he got for his pictures, and what he paid
            for his purchases, literary and artistic,—he tells how he heard
            of Luther's condemnation at Worms, of the Reformer's
            disappearance, of his supposed murder by Popish emissaries (for
            so the report went through Germany), and the news compelled him
            to that pouring forth of prayers, of exclamations, of fervent
            appeals, and of bitter regrets, which fills three out of the
            whole forty-six pages. The Luther he almost worships is the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“pious man,”</span> the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“follower of the Lord and of the true Christian
            faith,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“man enlightened by
            the Holy Spirit,”</span> the man who had been done to death by
            the Pope and the priests of his day, as the Son of God had been
            murdered by the priests of Jerusalem. The one <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id=
            "Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> thing which fills the great
            painter's mind is the personal religious life of the man Martin
            Luther.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href=
            "#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another source
            of Luther's power was that he had been led step by step, and that
            his countrymen could follow him deliberately without being
            startled by any too sudden changes. He was one of themselves; he
            took them into his confidence at every stage of his public
            career; they knew him thoroughly. He had been a monk, and that
            was natural for a youth of his exemplary piety. He had lived a
            model monastic life; his companions and his superiors were
            unwearied in commending him. He had spoken openly what almost all
            good men had been feeling privately about Indulgences in plain
            language which all could understand; and he had gradually taught
            himself and his countrymen, who were following his career
            breathlessly, that the man who trusted in God did not need to
            fear the censures of Pope or of the clergy. He emancipated not
            merely the learned and cultivated classes, but the common people,
            from the fear of the Church; and this was the one thing needful
            for a true reformation. So long as the people of Europe believed
            that the priesthood had some mysterious powers, no matter how
            vague or indefinite, over the spiritual and eternal welfare of
            men and women, freedom of conscience and a renovation of the
            public and private moral life was impossible. The spiritual world
            will always have its anxieties and terrors for every Christian
            soul, and the greatest achievement of Luther was that by teaching
            and, above all, by example, he showed the common man that he was
            in God's hands, and not dependent on the blessing or banning of a
            clerical caste. For Luther's doctrine of Justification by Faith,
            as he himself showed in his tract on the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Liberty of a
            Christian Man</span></span> (1520), was simply that there was
            nothing in the indefinite claim which the mediæval Church had
            always made. From the moment the common people, simple men and
            women, knew and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg
            193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            felt this, they were freed from the mysterious dread of Church
            and priesthood; they could look the clergy fairly in the face,
            and could care little for their threats. It was because Luther
            had freed himself from this dread, because the people, who knew
            him to be a deeply pious man, saw that he was free from it, and
            therefore that they need be in no concern about it, that he
            became the great reformer and the popular leader in an age which
            was compelled to revise its thoughts about spiritual things.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence it is
            that we may say without exaggeration that the Reformation was
            embodied in Martin Luther, that it lived in him as in no one
            else, and that its inner religious history may be best studied in
            the record of his spiritual experiences and in the growth of his
            religious convictions.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 120%">§ 2. Luther's Youth and
            Education.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martin Luther
            was born in 1483 (Nov. 10th) at Eisleben, and spent his childhood
            in the small mining town of Mansfeld. His father, Hans Luther,
            had belonged to Möhra (Moortown), a small peasant township lying
            in the north-east corner of the Thuringian Wald, and his mother,
            Margarethe Ziegler, had come from a burgher family in Eisenach.
            It was a custom among these Thuringian peasants that only one
            son, and that usually the youngest, inherited the family house
            and the croft. The others were sent out one by one, furnished
            with a small store of money from the family strong-box, to make
            their way in the world. Hans Luther had determined to become a
            miner in the Mansfeld district, where the policy of the Counts of
            Mansfeld, of building and letting out on hire small smelting
            furnaces, enabled thrifty and skilled workmen to rise in the
            world. The father soon made his way. He leased one and then three
            of these furnaces. He won the respect of his neighbours, for he
            became, in 1491, one of the four members of the village council,
            and we are told that the Counts of Mansfeld held him in
            esteem.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the earlier
            years, when Luther was a child, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> family life was one of grinding poverty,
            and Luther often recalled the hard struggles of his parents. He
            had often seen his mother carrying the wood for the family fire
            from the forest on her poor shoulders. The child grew up among
            the hard, grimy, coarse surroundings of the German working-class
            life, protected from much that was evil by the wise severity of
            his parents. He imbibed its simple political and ecclesiastical
            ideas. He learned that the Emperor was God's ruler on earth, who
            would protect poor people against the Turk, and that the Church
            was the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pope's House,”</span> in which
            the Bishop of Rome was the house-father. He was taught the Creed,
            the Ten Commandments, and the Lord's Prayer. He sang such simple
            evangelical hymns as <span class="tei tei-q">“Ein Kindelein so
            lobelich,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Nun bitten wir den
            heiligen Geist,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Crist ist
            erstanden.”</span> He was a dreamy, contemplative child; and the
            unseen world was never out of his thoughts. He knew that some of
            the miners practised sorcery in dark corners below the earth. He
            feared an old woman who lived near; she was a witch, and the
            priest himself was afraid of her. He was taught about Hell and
            Purgatory and the Judgment to come. He shivered whenever he
            looked at the stained-glass window in the parish church and saw
            the frowning face of Jesus, who, seated on a rainbow and with a
            flaming sword in His hand, was coming to judge him, he knew not
            when. He saw the crowds of pilgrims who streamed past Mansfeld,
            carrying their crucifixes high, and chanting their pilgrim songs,
            going to the Bruno Quertfort chapel or to the old church at
            Wimmelberg. He saw paralytics and maimed folk carried along the
            roads, going to embrace the wooden cross at Kyffhaüser, and find
            a miraculous cure; and sick people on their way to the cloister
            church at Wimmelberg to be cured by the sound of the blessed
            bells.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The boy Luther
            went to the village school in Mansfeld, and endured the cruelties
            of a merciless pedagogue. He was sent for a year, in 1497, to a
            school of the Brethren of the Common Lot in Magdeburg. Then he
            went to St. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg
            195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            George's school in Eisenach, where he remained three years. He
            was a <span class="tei tei-q">“poor scholar,”</span> which meant
            a boy who received his lodging and education free, was obliged to
            sing in the church choir, and was allowed to sing in the streets,
            begging for food. The whole town was under the spell of St.
            Elizabeth, the pious landgravine, who had given up family life
            and all earthly comforts to earn a mediæval saintship. It
            contained nine monasteries and nunneries, many of them dating
            back to the days of St. Elizabeth; her good deeds were emblazoned
            on the windows of the church in which Luther sang as choir-boy;
            he had long conversations with the monks who belonged to her
            foundations. The boy was being almost insensibly attracted to
            that revival of the mediæval religious life which was the popular
            religious force of these days. He had glimpses of the old homely
            evangelical piety, this time accompanied by a refinement of
            manners Luther had hitherto been unacquainted with, in the house
            of a lady who is identified by biographers with a certain Frau
            Cotta. The boy enjoyed it intensely, and his naturally sunny
            nature expanded under its influence. But it did not touch him
            religiously. He has recorded that it was with incredulous
            surprise that he heard his hostess say that there was nothing on
            earth more lovely than the love of husband and wife, when it is
            in the fear of the Lord.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After three
            years' stay at Eisenach, Luther entered the University of Erfurt
            (1501), then the most famous in Germany. It had been founded in
            1392 by the burghers of the town, who were intensely proud of
            their own University, and especially of the fact that it had far
            surpassed other seats of learning which owed their origin to
            princes. The academic and burgher life were allied at Erfurt as
            they were in no other University town. The days of graduation
            were always town holidays, and at the graduation processions the
            officials of the city walked with the University authorities.
            Luther tells us that when he first saw the newly made graduates
            marching in their new graduation robes in the middle of the
            procession, he thought that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> they had attained to the summit of earthly
            felicity. The University of Erfurt was also strictly allied to
            the Church. Different Popes had enriched it with privileges; the
            Primate of Germany, the Archbishop of Mainz, was its Chancellor:
            many of its professors held ecclesiastical prebends, or were
            monks; each faculty was under the protection of a tutelary saint;
            the teachers had to swear to teach nothing opposed to the
            doctrines of the Roman Church; and special pains were taken to
            prevent the rise and spread of heresy.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Its students
            were exposed to a greater variety of influences than those of any
            other seat of learning in Germany. Its theology represented the
            more modern type of scholastic, the Scotist; its philosophy was
            the nominalist teaching of William of Occam, whose great
            disciple, Gabriel Biel (d. 1495), had been one of its most
            celebrated professors; the system of biblical interpretation,
            first introduced by Nicholas de Lyra<a id="noteref_132" name=
            "noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a> (d.
            1340), had been long taught at Erfurt by a succession of able
            masters; Humanism had won an early entrance, and in Luther's time
            the Erfurt circle of <span class="tei tei-q">“Poets”</span> was
            already famous. The strongly anti-clerical teaching of John of
            Wessel, who had lectured in Erfurt for fifteen years (1445-1460),
            had left its mark on the University, and was not forgotten.
            Hussite propagandists, Luther tells us, appeared from time to
            time, whispering among the students their strange, anti-clerical
            Christian socialism. While, as if by way of antidote, there came
            Papal Legates, whose magnificence bore witness to the might of
            the Roman Church.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther had
            been sent to Erfurt to learn Law, and the Faculty of Philosophy
            gave the preliminary training required. <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> The young student worked hard at the
            prescribed tasks. The Scholastic Philosophy, he said, left him
            little time for classical studies, and he attended none of the
            Humanist lectures. He found time, however, to read a good many
            Latin authors privately, and also to learn something of Greek.
            Virgil and Plautus were his favourite authors; Cicero also
            charmed him; he read Livy, Terence, and Horace. He seems also to
            have read a volume of selections from Propertius, Persius,
            Lucretius, Tibullus, Silvius Italicus, Statius, and Claudian. But
            he was never a member of the Humanist circle; he was too much in
            earnest about religious questions, and of too practical a turn of
            mind.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The scanty
            accounts of Luther's student days show that he was a hardworking,
            bright, sociable youth, and musical to the core. His companions
            called him <span class="tei tei-q">“the Philosopher,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Musician,”</span> and spoke of his
            lute-playing, of his singing, and of his ready power in debate.
            He took his various degrees in unusually short time. He was
            Bachelor in 1502, and Master in 1505. His father, proud of his
            son's success, had sent him the costly present of a <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Corpus
            Juris</span></span>. He may have begun to attend the lectures in
            the Faculty of Law, when he suddenly plunged into the Erfurt
            Convent of the Augustinian Eremites.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The action was
            so sudden and unexpected, that contemporaries felt bound to give
            all manner of explanations, and these have been woven together
            into accounts which are legendary.<a id="noteref_133" name=
            "noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a>
            Luther himself has told us that he entered the monastery because
            he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">doubted of himself</span></em>; that in his
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name=
            "Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> case the proverb
            was true, <span class="tei tei-q">“Doubt makes a monk.”</span> He
            also said that his resolve was a sudden one, because he knew that
            his decision would grieve his father and his mother.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What was the
            doubting? We are tempted in these days to think of intellectual
            difficulties, and Luther's doubting is frequently attributed to
            the self-questioning which his contact with Humanism at Erfurt
            had engendered. But this idea, if not foreign to the age, was
            strange to Luther. His was a simple pious nature, practical
            rather than speculative, sensitive and imaginative. He could play
            with abstract questions; but it was pictures that compelled him
            to action. He has left on record a series of pictures which were
            making deeper and more permanent impression on him as the years
            passed; they go far to reveal the history of his struggles, and
            to tell us what the doubts were which drove him into the convent.
            The picture on the window in Mansfeld church of Jesus sitting on
            a rainbow, with frowning countenance and drawn sword in His hand,
            coming to judge the wicked; the altar-piece at Magdeburg
            representing a great ship sailing heavenwards, no one within the
            ship but priests or monks, and in the sea laymen drowning, or
            saved by ropes thrown to them by the priests and monks who were
            safe on board; the living picture of the prince of Anhalt, who to
            save his soul had become a friar, and carried the begging sack on
            his bent shoulders through the streets of Magdeburg; the history
            of St. Elizabeth blazoned on the windows of the church at
            Eisenach; the young Carthusian at Eisenach, who the boy thought
            was the holiest man he had ever talked to, and who had so
            mortified his body that he had come to look like a very old man;
            the terrible deathbed scene of the Erfurt ecclesiastical
            dignitary, a man who held twenty-two benefices, and whom Luther
            had often seen riding in state in the great processions, who was
            known to be an evil-liver, and who when he came to die filled the
            room with his frantic cries. Luther doubted whether he could ever
            do what he believed had to be done <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> by him to save his soul if he remained in
            the world. That was what compelled him to become a monk, and bury
            himself in the convent. The lurid fires of Hell and the pale
            shades of Purgatory, which are the permanent background to
            Dante's Paradise, were present to Luther's mind from childhood.
            Could he escape the one and gain entrance to the other if he
            remained in the world? He doubted it, and entered the
            convent.</p>

            convent of the Augustinian Eremites, perhaps the most highly
            esteemed of monastic orders by the common people of Germany
            during the earlier decades of the sixteenth century. They
            represented the very best type of that superstitious mediæval
            revival which has been already described.<a id="noteref_134"

            is a mistake to suppose that because they bore the name of
            Augustine, the evangelical theology of the great Western Father
            was known to them. Their leading theologians belonged to another
            and very different school. The two teachers of theology in the
            Erfurt convent, when Luther entered in 1505, were John Genser of
            Paltz, and John Nathin of Neuenkirchen. The former was widely
            known from his writings in favour of the strictest form of papal
            absolutism, of the doctrine of <span class=

            latter, though unknown beyond the walls of the convent, was an
            able and severe master. He was an ardent admirer of Gabriel Biel,
            of Peter d'Ailly, and of William of Occam their common master. He
            thought little of any independent <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            "tei tei-q">“Brother Martin,”</span> he once said to Luther,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“let the Bible alone; read the old
            teachers; they give you the whole marrow of the Bible; reading
            the Bible simply breeds unrest.”</span><a id="noteref_136" name=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a>
            Afterwards he commanded Luther on his canonical obedience to
            refrain from Bible study.<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137"
            href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a> It
            was he who made Luther read and re-read the writings of Biel,
            d'Ailly, and Occam, until he had committed to memory long
            passages; and who taught the Reformer to consider Occam
            <span class="tei tei-q">“his dear Master.”</span> Nathin was a
            determined opponent of the Reformation until his death in 1529;
            but Luther always spoke of him with respect, and said that he was
            <span class="tei tei-q">“a Christian man in spite of his monk's
            cowl.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther had not
            come to the convent to study theology; he had entered it to save
            his soul. These studies were part of the convent discipline; to
            engage in them, part of his vow of obedience. He worked hard at
            them, and pleased his superiors greatly; worked because he was a
            submissive monk. They left a deeper impress on him than most of
            his biographers have cared to acknowledge. He had more of the
            Schoolman in him and less of the Humanist than any other of the
            men who stood in the first line of leaders in the Reformation
            movement. Some of his later doctrines, and especially his theory
            of the Sacrament of the Supper, came to him from these convent
            studies in d'Ailly and Occam. But in his one great quest—how to
            save his soul, how to win the sense of God's pardon—they were
            more a hindrance than a help. His teachers might be Augustinian
            Eremites, but they had not the faintest knowledge of Augustinian
            experimental theology. They belonged to the most pelagianising
            school of mediæval Scholastic; and their last word always was
            that man must work out his own salvation. Luther tried to work it
            out <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name=
            "Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the most
            approved later mediæval fashion, by the strictest asceticism. He
            fasted and scourged himself; he practised all the ordinary forms
            of maceration, and invented new ones; but all to no purpose. For
            when an awakened soul, as he said long afterwards, seeks to find
            rest in work-righteousness, it stands on a foundation of loose
            sand which it feels running and travelling beneath it; and it
            must go from one good work to another and to another, and so on
            without end. Luther was undergoing all unconsciously the
            experience of Augustine, and what tortured and terrified the
            great African was torturing him. He had learned that man's
            goodness is not to be measured by his neighbour's but by God's,
            and that man's sin is not to be weighed against the sins of his
            neighbours, but against the righteousness of God. His theological
            studies told him that God's pardon could be had through the
            Sacrament of Penance, and that the first part of that sacrament
            was sorrow for sin. But then came a difficulty. The older, and
            surely the better theology, explained that this godly sorrow
            (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">contritio</span></span>)
            must be based on love to God. Had he this love? God always
            appeared to him as an implacable Judge, inexorably threatening
            punishment for the breaking of a law which it seemed impossible
            to keep. He had to confess to himself that he sometimes almost
            hated this arbitrary Will which the nominalist Schoolmen called
            God. The more modern theology, that taught by the chief convent
            theologian, John of Paltz, asserted that the sorrow might be
            based on meaner motives (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">attritio</span></span>), and that this
            attrition was changed into contrition in the Sacrament of Penance
            itself. So Luther wearied his superiors by his continual use of
            this sacrament. The slightest breach of the most trifling
            conventual regulation was looked on as a sin, and had to be
            confessed at once and absolution for it received, until the
            perplexed lad was ordered to cease confession until he had
            committed some sin worth confessing. His brethren believed him to
            be a miracle of piety. They boasted about him in their monkish
            fashion, and in all the monasteries around, and as far away as
            Grimma, the monks <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg
            202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            and nuns talked about the young saint in the Erfurt convent.
            Meanwhile the <span class="tei tei-q">“young saint”</span>
            himself lived a life of mental anguish, whispering to himself
            that he was <span class="tei tei-q">“gallows-ripe.”</span>
            Writing in 1518, years after the conflict was over, Luther tells
            us that no pen could describe the mental anguish he
            endured.<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href=
            "#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a>
            Gleams of comfort came to him, but they were transient. The
            Master of the Novices gave him salutary advice; an aged brother
            gave him momentary comfort. John Staupitz, the Vicar-General of
            the Congregation, during his visits to the convent was attracted
            by the traces of hidden conflicts and sincere endeavour of the
            young monk, with his high cheek-bones, emaciated frame, gleaming
            eyes, and looks of settled despair. He tried to find out his
            difficulties. He revoked Nathin's order that Luther should not
            read the Scriptures. He encouraged him to read the Bible; he gave
            him a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Glossa Ordinaria</span></span> or conventual
            ecclesiastical commentary, where passages were explained by
            quotations from eminent Church Fathers, and difficulties were got
            over by much pious allegorising; above all, he urged him to
            become a good <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">localis</span></span> and
            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">textualis</span></span> in
            the Bible, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> one who, when he met with
            difficulties, did not content himself with commentaries, but made
            collections of parallel passages for himself, and found
            explanations of one in the others. Still this brought at first
            little help. At last Staupitz saw the young man's real
            difficulty, and gave him real and lasting assistance. He showed
            Luther that he had been rightly enough contrasting man's sin and
            God's holiness, and measuring the depth of the one by the height
            of the other; that he had been following the truest instincts of
            the deepest piety when he had set over-against each other the
            righteousness of God and the sin and helplessness of man; but
            that he had gone wrong when he kept these two <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id=
            "Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> thoughts in a <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">permanent</span></em> opposition. He then
            explained that, according to God's promise, the righteousness of
            God might become man's own possession in and through Christ
            Jesus. God had promised that man could have fellowship with Him;
            all fellowship is founded on personal trust; and trust, the
            personal trust of the believing man on a personal God who has
            promised, gives man that fellowship with God through which all
            things that belong to God can become his. Without this personal
            trust or faith, all divine things, the Incarnation and Passion of
            the Saviour, the Word and the Sacraments, however true as matters
            of fact, are outside man and cannot be truly possessed. But when
            man trusts God and His promises, and when the fellowship, which
            trust or faith always creates, is once established, then they can
            be truly possessed by the man who trusts. The just live by their
            faith. These thoughts, acted upon, helped Luther gradually to win
            his way to peace, and he told Staupitz long afterwards that it
            was he who had made him see the rays of light which dispelled the
            darkness of his soul.<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href=
            "#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a> In
            the end, the vision of the true relation of the believing man to
            God came to him suddenly with all the force of a personal
            revelation, and the storm-tossed soul was at rest. The sudden
            enlightenment, the personal revelation which was to change his
            whole life, came to him when he was reading the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistle to the
            Romans</span></span> in his cell. It came to Paul when he was
            riding on the road to Damascus; to Augustine as he was lying
            under a fig-tree in the Milan garden; to Francis as he paced
            anxiously the flag-stones of the Portiuncula chapel on the plain
            beneath Assisi; to Suso as he sat at table in the morning. It
            spoke through different words:—to Paul, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Why persecutest thou Me?”</span>;<a id="noteref_140"
            name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class=

            Augustine, <span class="tei tei-q">“Put ye on the Lord Jesus
            Christ, and make not provision for the flesh”</span>;<a id=

            Francis, <span class="tei tei-q">“Get you no gold, nor silver,
            nor brass in your purses, no wallet for your journey, neither two
            coats, nor shoes, nor staff”</span>;<a id="noteref_142" name=
            "noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a> to
            Suso, <span class="tei tei-q">“My son, if <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id=
            "Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> thou wilt hear My
            words.”</span><a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href=
            "#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a> But
            though the words were different, the personal revelation, which
            mastered the men, was the same: That trust in the All-merciful
            God, who has revealed Himself in Jesus Christ, creates
            companionship with God, and that all other things are nothing in
            comparison with this fellowship. It was this contact with the
            Unseen which fitted Luther for his task as the leader of men in
            an age which was longing for a revival of moral living inspired
            by a fresh religious impulse.<a id="noteref_144" name=
            "noteref_144" href="#note_144"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
            certain how long Luther's protracted struggle lasted. There are
            indications that it went on for two years, and that he did not
            attain to inward peace until shortly before he was sent to
            Wittenberg in 1508. The intensity and sincerity of the conflict
            marked him for life. The conviction that he, weak and sinful as
            he was, nevertheless lived in personal fellowship with the God
            whose love he was experiencing, became the one fundamental fact
            of life on which he, a human personality, could take his stand as
            on a foundation of rock; and standing on it, feeling his own
            strength, he could also be a source of strength to others.
            Everything else, however venerable and sacred it might once have
            seemed, might prove untrustworthy without hereafter disturbing
            Luther's religious life, provided only this one thing remained to
            him. For the moment, however, nothing seemed questionable. The
            inward change <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg
            205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            altered nothing external. He still believed that the Church was
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pope's House”</span>; he accepted
            all its usages and institutions—its Masses and its relics, its
            indulgences and its pilgrimages, its hierarchy and its monastic
            life. He was still a monk and believed in his vocation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther's
            theological studies were continued. He devoted himself especially
            to Bernard, in whose sermons on the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Song of
            Solomon</span></span> he found the same thoughts of the relation
            of the believing soul to God which had given him comfort. He
            began to show himself a good man of business with an eye to the
            heart of things. Staupitz and his chiefs entrusted him with some
            delicate commissions on behalf of the Order, and made quiet
            preparations for his advancement. In 1508 he, with a few other
            monks, was sent from Erfurt to the smaller convent at Wittenberg,
            to assist the small University there.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About the
            beginning of the century, Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony
            and head of the Ernestine branch of his family, had resolved to
            establish a University for his dominions. Frederick had
            maintained close relations with the Augustinian Eremites ever
            since he had made acquaintance with them when a schoolboy at
            Grimma, and the Vicar-General, John Staupitz, along with Dr.
            Pollich of Mellerstadt, were his chief advisers. It might almost
            be said that the new University was, from the beginning, an
            educational establishment belonging to the Order of monks which
            Luther had joined. Staupitz himself was one of the professors,
            and Dean of the Faculty of Theology; another Augustinian Eremite
            was Dean of the Faculty of Arts; the Patron Saints of the Order
            of the Blessed Virgin and St. Augustine were the Patron Saints of
            the University; St. Paul was the Patron Saint of the Faculty of
            Theology, and on the day of his conversion there was a special
            celebration of the Mass with a sermon, at which the Rector (Dr.
            Pollich) and the whole teaching staff were
            present.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg
            206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The University
            was poorly endowed. Electoral Saxony was not a rich principality;
            some mining industry did exist in the south end, and Zwickau was
            the centre of a great weaving trade; but the great proportion of
            the inhabitants, whether of villages or towns, subsisted on
            agriculture of a poor kind. There was not much money at the
            Electoral court. A sum got from the sale of Indulgences some
            years before, which Frederick had not allowed to leave the
            country, served to make a beginning. The prebends attached to the
            Church of All Saints (the Castle Church) supplied the salaries of
            some professors; the others were Augustinian Eremites, who gave
            their services gratuitously.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The town of
            Wittenberg was more like a large village than the capital of a
            principality. In 1513 it only contained 3000 inhabitants and 356
            rateable houses. The houses were for the most part mean wooden
            dwellings, roughly plastered with clay. The town lay in the very
            centre of Germany, but it was far from any of the great trade
            routes; the inhabitants had a good deal of Wendish blood in their
            veins, and were inclined to be sluggish and intemperate. The
            environs were not picturesque, and the surrounding country had a
            poor soil. Altogether it was scarcely the place for a University.
            Imperial privileges were obtained from the Emperor Maximilian,
            and the University was opened on the 18th of October 1502.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One or two
            eminent teachers had been induced to come to the new University.
            Staupitz collected promising young monks from many convents of
            his Order and enrolled them as students, and the University
            entered 416 names on its books during its first year. This
            success seems to have been somewhat artificial, for the numbers
            gradually declined to 56 in the summer session of 1505. Staupitz,
            however, encouraged Frederick to persevere.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was in the
            interests of the young University that Luther and a band of
            brother monks were sent from Erfurt to the Wittenberg convent.
            There he was set to teach the Dialectic and Physics of
            Aristotle,—a hateful task,—but whether to the monks in the
            convent or in the University <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> it is impossible to say. All the while
            Staupitz urged him to study theology in order to teach it. It was
            then that Luther began his systematic study of Augustine. He also
            began to preach. His first sermons were delivered in an old
            chapel, 30 feet long and 20 feet wide, built of wood plastered
            over with clay. He preached to the monks. Dr. Pollich, the
            Rector, went sometimes to hear him, and spoke to the Elector of
            the young monk with piercing eyes and strange fancies in his
            head.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His work was
            interrupted by a command to go to Rome on business of his Order
            (autumn 1511). His selection was a great honour, and Luther felt
            it to be so; but it may be questioned whether he did not think
            more of the fact that he would visit the Holy City as a devout
            pilgrim, and be able to avail himself of the spiritual privileges
            which he believed were to be found there. When he got to the end
            of his journey and first caught a glimpse of the city, he raised
            his hands in an ecstasy, exclaiming, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
            greet thee, thou Holy Rome, thrice holy from the blood of the
            martyrs.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When his
            official work was done he set about seeing the Holy City with the
            devotion of a pilgrim. He visited all the famous shrines,
            especially those to which Indulgences were attached. He listened
            reverently to all the accounts given of the relics which were
            exhibited to the pilgrims, and believed in all the tales told
            him. He thought that if his parents had been dead he could have
            assured them against Purgatory by saying Masses in certain
            chapels. Only once, it is said, his soul showed revolt. He was
            slowly climbing on his knees the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scala
            Santa</span></span> (really a mediæval staircase), said to have
            been the stone steps leading up to Pilate's house in Jerusalem,
            once trodden by the feet of our Lord; when half-way up the
            thought came into his mind, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">The just shall live by his
            faith</span></em>; he stood upright and walked slowly down. He
            saw, as thousands of pious German pilgrims had done before his
            time, the moral corruptions which disgraced the Holy City—infidel
            priests who scoffed at the sacred mysteries they performed,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name=
            "Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and princes of the
            Church who lived in open sin. He saw and loathed the moral
            degradation, and the scenes imprinted themselves on his memory;
            but his home and cloister training enabled him, for the time
            being, in spite of the loathing, to revel in the memorials of the
            old heroic martyrs, and to look on their relics as storehouses of
            divine grace. In later days it was the memories of the vices of
            the Roman Court that helped him to harden his heart against the
            sentiment which surrounded the Holy City.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Luther
            returned to Wittenberg in the early summer of 1512, his
            Vicar-General sent him to Erfurt to complete his training for the
            doctorate in theology. He graduated as Doctor of the Holy
            Scripture, took the Wittenberg Doctor's oath to defend the
            evangelical truth vigorously (<span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">viriliter</span></span>), was made a member
            of the Wittenberg Senate, and three weeks later succeeded
            Staupitz as Professor of Theology.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther was
            still a genuine monk, with no doubt of his vocation. He became
            sub-prior of the Wittenberg convent in 1512, and was made the
            District Vicar over the eleven convents in Meissen and Thuringia
            in 1515. But that side of his life may be passed over. It is his
            theological work as professor in Wittenberg University that is
            important for his career as a reformer.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 120%">§ 5. Luther's early Lectures in
            Theology.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
            beginning his lectures on theology differed from those ordinarily
            given, but not because he had any theological opinions at
            variance with those of his old teachers at Erfurt. No one
            attributed any sort of heretical views to the young Wittenberg
            professor. His mind was intensely practical, and he believed that
            theology might be made useful to guide men to find the grace of
            God and to tell them how, having acquired through trust a sense
            of fellowship with God, they could persevere in a life of joyous
            obedience to God and His commandments. The Scholastic theologians
            of Erfurt and elsewhere did not <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> look on theology as a practical discipline
            of this kind. Luther thought that theology ought to discuss such
            matters, and he knew that his main interest in theology lay on
            this practical side. Besides, as he has told us, he regarded
            himself as specially set apart to lecture on the Holy Scriptures.
            So, like John Colet, he began by expounding the Epistles of St.
            Paul and the Psalms.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther never
            knew much Hebrew, and he used the Vulgate in his prelections. He
            had a huge widely printed volume on his desk, and wrote out the
            heads of his lectures between the printed lines. Some of the
            pages still survive in the Wolfenbüttel Library, and can be
            studied.<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href=

            "Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> His lectures were
            experimental. He started with the fact of man's sin, the
            possibility of reaching a sense of pardon and of fellowship with
            God through trust in His promises. From the beginning we find in
            the germ what grew to be the main thoughts in the later Lutheran
            theology. Men are redeemed apart from any merits of their own;
            God's grace is really His mercy revealed in the mission and work
            of Christ; it has to do with the forgiveness of sins, and is the
            fulfilment of His promises; man's faith is trust in the
            historical work of Christ and in the verity of God. These
            thoughts were for the most part all expressed in the formal
            language of the Scholastic Theology of the day. They grew in
            clearness, and took shape in a series of propositions which
            formed the common basis of his teaching: man wins pardon through
            the free grace of God: when man lays hold on God's promise of
            pardon he becomes a new creature; this sense of pardon is the
            beginning of a new life of sanctification; the life of faith is
            Christianity on its inward side; the contrast between the law and
            the gospel is something fundamental: there is a real distinction
            between the outward and visible Church and the ideal Church,
            which latter is to be described by its spiritual and moral
            relations to God after the manner of Augustine. All these
            thoughts simply pushed aside the ordinary theology as taught in
            the schools without staying to criticise it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the years
            1515 and 1516, which bear traces of a more thoroughgoing study of
            Augustine and of the German mediæval Mystics, Luther began to
            find that he could not express the thoughts he desired to convey
            in the ordinary language of Scholastic Theology, and that its
            phrases suggested ideas other than those he wished to set forth.
            He tried to find another set of expressions. It is characteristic
            of Luther's conservatism, that in theological phraseology, as
            afterwards in ecclesiastical institutions and ceremonies, he
            preferred to retain what had been in use provided only he could
            put his own evangelical meaning into it in a not too arbitrary
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name=
            "Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> way.<a id=
            "noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href="#note_148"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a>
            Having found that the Scholastic phraseology did not always suit
            his purpose, he turned to the popular mystical authors, and
            discovered there a rich store of phrases in which he could
            express his ideas of the imperfection of man towards what is
            good. Along with this change in language, and related to it, we
            find evidence that Luther was beginning to think less highly of
            the monastic life with its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">external</span></em> renunciations. The
            thought of predestination, meaning by that not an abstract
            metaphysical category, but the conception that the whole
            believer's life, and what it involved, depended in the last
            resort on God and not on man, came more and more into the
            foreground. Still there does not seem any disposition to
            criticise or to repudiate the current theology of the day.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The earliest
            traces of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">conscious</span></em> opposition appeared
            about the middle of 1516, and characteristically on the practical
            and not on the speculative side of theology. They began in a
            sermon on Indulgences, preached in July 1516. Once begun, the
            breach widened until Luther could contrast <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“our theology”</span><a id="noteref_149" name=
            "noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class=

            (the theology taught by Luther and his colleagues at Wittenberg)
            with what was taught elsewhere, and notably at Erfurt. The former
            represented Augustine and the Holy Scriptures, and the latter was
            founded on Aristotle. In September 1517 he raised the standard of
            theological revolt, and wrote directly against the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Scholastic Theology”</span>; he declared that it was
            Pelagian at heart, and buried out of sight the Augustinian
            doctrines of grace; he lamented the fact that it neglected to
            teach the supreme value of faith and of inward righteousness;
            that it encouraged <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg
            212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            men to seek escape from what was due for sin by means of
            Indulgences, instead of exhorting them to practise the inward
            repentance which belongs to every genuine Christian life.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was at this
            interesting stage of his own religious development that Luther
            felt himself forced to oppose publicly the sale of Indulgences in
            Germany.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the year
            1517, Luther had become a power in Wittenberg both as a preacher
            and as a teacher. He had become the preacher in the town church,
            from whose pulpit he delivered many sermons every week, taking
            infinite pains to make himself understood by the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“raw Saxons.”</span> He became a great preacher, and,
            like all great preachers, he denounced prevalent sins, and
            bewailed the low standard of morals set before the people by the
            higher ecclesiastical authorities; he said that religion was not
            an easy thing; that it did not consist in the decent performance
            of external ceremonies; that the sense of sin, the experience of
            the grace of God, and the fear of God and the overcoming of that
            fear through the love of God, were all continuous
            experiences.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His exegetical
            lectures seemed like a rediscovery of the Holy Scriptures. Grave
            burghers of Wittenberg matriculated as students in order to hear
            them. The fame of the lecturer spread, and students from all
            parts of Germany crowded to the small remote University, until
            the Elector became proud of his seat of learning and of the man
            who had made it prosper.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such a man
            could not keep silent when he saw what he believed to be a grave
            source of moral evil approaching the people whose souls God had
            given him in charge; and this is how Luther came to be a
            Reformer.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Up to this
            time he had been an obedient monk, doing diligently the work
            given him, highly esteemed by his superiors, fulfilling the
            expectations of his Vicar-General, and recognised by all as a
            quiet and eminently pious man. He had a strong, simple character,
            with nothing of the quixotic about him. Of course he saw the
            degradation of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg
            213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            much of the religious life of the times, and had attended at
            least one meeting where those present discussed plans of
            reformation. He had then (at Leitzkau in 1512) declared that
            every true reformation must begin with individual men, that it
            must reveal itself in a regenerate heart aflame with faith
            kindled by the preaching of a pure gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What drew
            Luther from his retirement was an Indulgence proclaimed by Pope
            Leo <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Brandenburg, the Archbishop of Mainz, and preached by John

            Indulgence tickets were called. It had been announced that the

            St. Peter to be a tomb worthy of the great Apostle, who rested,
            it was said, in a Roman grave.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            Indulgence-seller had usually a magnificent reception when he
            entered a German town. Frederick Mecum (Myconius), who was an
            eye-witness, thus describes the entrance of Tetzel into the town

            the schoolmasters and their scholars, and all the men and women
            went out to meet him with banners and candles and songs, forming
            a great procession; then all the bells ringing and all the organs
            playing, they accompanied him to the principal church; a red
            cross was set up in the midst of the church, and the Pope's

            <span class="tei tei-q">“the gate of heaven was open,”</span> and

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many German

            territories. But the lands of Ernestine (Electoral) and Albertine
            (Ducal) Saxony were so mixed up that it was easy for the
            Commissary to command the whole population of Electoral Saxony
            without actually crossing the frontier. The <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Red Cross”</span> had been set up in Zerbst in Ducal
            Saxony a few miles to the west, and at Jüterbogk in the territory
            of Magdeburg a few miles to the east of Wittenberg, and people
            had gone from the town to buy the Indulgence. Luther believed
            that the sales were injurious to the moral and religious life of
            his townsmen; the reports of the sermons and addresses of the
            Indulgence-seller which reached him appeared to contain what he
            believed to be both lies and blasphemies. He secured a copy of
            the letter of recommendation given by the Archbishop to his
            Commissary, and his indignation grew stronger. Still it was only
            after much hesitation, after many of his friends had urged him to
            interfere, and in deep distress of mind, that he resolved to
            protest. When he had determined to do something he went about the
            matter with a mixture of caution and courage which were
            characteristic of the man.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Church of
            All Saints (the Castle Church) in Wittenberg had always been
            intimately connected with the University; its prebendaries were
            professors; its doors were used as a board on which to publish
            important academic documents; and notices of public academic
            <span class="tei tei-q">“disputations,”</span> common enough at
            the time, had frequently appeared there. The day of the year
            which drew the largest concourse of townsmen and strangers to the
            church was All Saints' Day, the first of November. It was the
            anniversary of the consecration of the building, and was
            commemorated by a prolonged series of services. The Elector
            Frederick was a great collector of relics, and had stored his
            collection in the church.<a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150"

            Indulgence to benefit all who came to attend the anniversary
            services and look at the relics.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On All Saints'
            Day, Luther nailed his Ninety-five Theses to the door of the
            church. It was a strictly academic proceeding. The Professor of
            Theology in Wittenberg, wishing to elucidate the truth, offered
            to discuss, either by speech or by writing, the matter of
            Indulgences.<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href=
            "#note_151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a> He
            put forth ninety-five propositions or heads of discussion which
            he proposed to maintain. Academic etiquette was strictly
            preserved; the subject, judged by the numberless books which had
            been written on it, and the variety of opinions expressed, was
            eminently suitable for debate; the Theses were offered as
            subjects of debate; and the author, according to the usage of the
            time in such cases, was not supposed to be definitely committed
            to the opinions expressed.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Theses,
            however, differed from most programmes of academic discussions in
            this, that everyone wanted to read them. A duplicate was made in
            German. Copies of the Latin original and the translation were
            sent to the University printing-house, and the presses could not
            throw them off fast enough to meet the demand which came from all
            parts of Germany.</p>

            of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Indulgences</span></span> pervaded the whole
            penitential system of the later mediæval Church, and had done so
            from the beginning of the thirteenth century. Its beginnings go
            back a thousand years before Luther's time.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the ancient
            Church, lapse into serious sin involved separation from the
            Christian fellowship, and readmission to communion was only to be
            had by public confession made in presence of the whole
            congregation, and by the manifestation of a true repentance in
            performing certain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> such as the
            manumission of slaves, prolonged fasting, extensive almsgiving,
            etc. These <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfactions</span></em> were the open
            signs of heartfelt sorrow, and were regarded as at once
            well-pleasing to God and evidence to the Christian community that
            the penitent had true repentance, and might be received back
            again into their midst. The confession was made to the whole
            congregation; the amount of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfaction</span></em> deemed necessary
            was estimated by the congregation, and readmission was also
            dependent on the will of the whole congregation. It often
            happened that these <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfactions</span></em> were mitigated or
            exchanged for others. The penitent might fall sick, and the
            fasting which had been prescribed could not be insisted upon
            without danger of death; in such a case the external sign of
            sorrow which had been demanded might be exchanged for another. Or
            it might happen that the community became convinced of the
            sincerity of the repentance without insisting that the whole of
            the prescribed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfaction</span></em> need be
            performed.<a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href=

            These exchanges and mitigations of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfactions</span></em> were the small
            beginnings of the later system of Indulgences.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In course of
            time the public confession of sins made to the whole congregation
            was exchanged for a private confession made to the priest, and
            instead of the public <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfaction</span></em> imposed by the
            whole congregation, it was left to the priest to enjoin a
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfaction</span></em> or external sign of
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name=
            "Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sorrow which he
            believed was appropriate to the sin committed and confessed. The
            substitution of a private confession to the priest for a public
            confession made to the whole congregation, enlarged the circle of
            sins confessed. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">secret</span></em> sins of the heart whose
            presence could be elicited by the questions of the confessor were
            added to the open sins seen of men. The circle of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfactions</span></em> was also widened
            in a corresponding fashion.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
            imposition of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfactions</span></em> was left in the
            hands of the priest, it was felt necessary to provide some check
            against the arbitrariness which could not fail to result. So
            books were published containing lists of sins with the
            corresponding appropriate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfactions</span></em> which ought to be
            demanded from the penitents. If it be remembered that some of the
            sins mentioned were very heinous (murders, incests, outrages of
            all kinds), it is not surprising that the appropriate <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfactions</span></em> or <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">penances</span></em>, as they came to be
            called, were very severe in some cases, and extended over a
            course of years. From the seventh century there arose a practice
            of commuting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfactions</span></em> or penances. A
            penance of several years' practice of fasting might be commuted
            into saying so many prayers or psalms, into giving a definite
            amount of alms, or even into a money fine—and in this last case
            the analogy of the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Wehrgeld</span></span> of the Germanic
            tribal codes was frequently followed.<a id="noteref_155" name=
            "noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a>
            These customary commutations were frequently inserted in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Penitentiaries</span></span> or books of
            discipline. This new custom commonly took the form that the
            penitent, who visited a certain church on a prescribed day and
            gave a contribution to its funds, had the penance, which had been
            imposed upon him by the priest in the ordinary course of
            discipline, shortened by one-seventh, one-third, one-half, as the
            case might be. This was in every case the commutation or
            relaxation of the penance or outward sign of sorrow which
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name=
            "Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> had been imposed
            according to the regulations of the Church, laid down in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Penitentiaries (relaxatio de injuncta
            pœnitentia).</span></span> This was the real origin of
            Indulgences, and these earliest examples were invariably a
            relaxation of ecclesiastical penalties which had been imposed
            according to the regular custom in cases of discipline. It will
            be seen that Luther expressly excluded this kind of Indulgence
            from his attack. He declared that what the Church had a right to
            impose, it had a right to relax. It was at first believed that
            this right to relax or commute imposed penances was in the hands
            of the priests who had charge of the discipline of the members of
            the Church; but the abuses of the system by the priests ended by
            placing the power to grant Indulgences in the hands of the
            bishops, and they used the money procured in building many of the
            great mediæval cathedrals. Episcopal abuse of Indulgences led to
            their being reserved for the Popes.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three
            conceptions, all of which belong to the beginning of the
            thirteenth century, combined to effect a great change on this old
            and simple idea of Indulgences. These were—(1) the formulation of
            the thought of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">thesaurus meritorum</span></span>); (2) the
            change of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">institution</span></em> into the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=

            the distinction between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">contrition</span></em> in the thought of the
            kind of sorrow God demands from a real penitent.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conception
            of a storehouse of merits (<span lang="la" class=

            was first formulated by Alexander of Hales<a id="noteref_156"
            name="noteref_156" href="#note_156"><span class=

            the thirteenth century, and his ideas were accepted, enlarged,
            and made more precise by succeeding theologians.<a id=

            Starting with the existing practice in the Church that some
            penances (such as pilgrimages) might be vicariously performed,
            and bringing together the several thoughts that the faithful are
            members of one body, that the good deeds of each of the members
            are the common property of all, and therefore that the more
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name=
            "Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sinful can benefit
            by the good deeds of their more saintly brethren, and that the
            sacrifice of Christ was sufficient to wipe out the sins of all,
            theologians gradually formulated the doctrine that there was a
            common storehouse which contained the good deeds of living men
            and women, of the saints in heaven and the inexhaustible merits
            of Christ, and that all these merits accumulated there had been
            placed under the charge of the Pope, and could be dispensed by
            him to the faithful. The doctrine was not very precisely defined
            by the beginning of the sixteenth century, but it was generally
            believed in, taught, and accepted. It went to increase the vague
            sense of supernatural, spiritual powers attached to the person of
            the Bishop of Rome. It had one important consequence on the
            doctrine of Indulgences. They might be the payment out of this
            treasury of an absolute equivalent for the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfaction</span></em> due by the penitent
            for his sins; they were no longer merely the substitution of one
            form of penance for another, or the relaxation of a penance
            enjoined.</p>

            through the command of the confessor; and the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Pardon</span></em> (<span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">absolutio</span></span>) pronounced by the
            priest in God's name. The pardon followed the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfaction</span></em>. But when the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">institution</span></em> became the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Sacrament of Penance</span></em>, the order
            was changed: absolution followed confession and came before
            satisfaction, which it had formerly followed. Satisfaction lost
            its old meaning. It was no longer the outward sign of sorrow and
            the necessary precedent of pardon or absolution. According to the
            new theory, the absolution which immediately followed confession
            had the effect of removing the whole guilt of the sins confessed,
            and with the guilt the whole of the eternal punishment due. This
            cancelling of guilt and of eternal punishment did not, however,
            forthwith open the gates of heaven to the pardoned sinner. It was
            felt that the justice of God could <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> not permit the baptized sinner to escape
            from all punishment whatever. Hence it was said that although
            eternal punishment had disappeared with the absolution, there
            remained temporal punishment due for the sins, and that heaven
            could not be entered until this temporal punishment had been
            endured.<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href=
            "#note_158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a>
            Temporal punishments might be of two kinds—those endured in this
            life, or those suffered in a place of punishment after death. The
            penance imposed by the priest, the satisfaction, now became the
            temporal punishment due for sins committed. If the priest had
            imposed the due amount, and if the penitent was able to perform
            all that had been imposed, the sins were expiated. But if the
            priest had imposed less than the justice of God actually
            demanded, then these temporal pains had to be completed in
            Purgatory. This gave rise to great uncertainty; for who could
            feel assured that the priest had calculated rightly, and had
            imposed satisfactions or temporal penalties which were of the
            precise amount demanded by the justice of God? Hence the pains of
            Purgatory threatened every man. It was here that the new idea of
            Indulgences came in to aid the faithful by securing him against
            the pains of Purgatory, which were not included in the absolution
            obtained in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Sacrament of Penance</span></span>.
            Indulgences in the sense of relaxations of imposed penances went
            into the background, and the really valuable Indulgence was one
            which, because of the merits transferred from the storehouse of
            merits, was an equivalent in God's sight for the temporal
            punishments due for sins. Thus, in the opinion of Alexander of
            Hales, of Bonaventura,<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159"
            href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a>
            and, above all, of Thomas Aquinas, the real <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id=
            "Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> value of Indulgences was that
            they procured the remission of penalties due after absolution,
            whether these penalties were penances imposed by the priest or
            not; and when the uncertainty of the imposed penalties is
            remembered, the most valuable of all Indulgences were those which
            had regard to the unimposed penalties; the priest might make a
            mistake, but God did not blunder.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While
            Indulgences were always connected with satisfactions, and changed
            with the changes in the meaning of the latter term, they were not
            the less influenced by a distinction which came to be drawn
            between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">attrition</span></em> and <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">contrition</span></em>, and by the
            application of the distinction to the theory of the Sacrament of
            Penance. During the earlier Middle Ages and down to the
            thirteenth century, it was always held that <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">contrition</span></em> (sorrow prompted by
            love) was the one thing taken into account by God in pardoning
            the sinner. The theologians of the thirteenth century, however,
            began to draw a distinction between this godly sorrow and a
            certain amount of sorrow which might arise from a variety of
            causes of a less worthy nature, and especially from servile fear.
            This was called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">attrition</span></em>; and it was held that
            this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">attrition</span></em>, though of itself too
            imperfect to win the pardon of God, might become perfected
            through the confession heard by the priest, and in the
            sacramental absolution pronounced by him. Very naturally, though
            perhaps illogically, it was believed that an imperfect sorrow,
            though sufficient to procure absolution, and, therefore, the
            blotting out of eternal punishment, merited more temporal
            punishment than if it had been sorrow of a godly sort. But it was
            these temporal penalties (including the pains of Purgatory) that
            Indulgences provided for. Hence, Indulgences appealed more
            strongly to the indifferent Christian, who knew that he had
            sinned, and at the same time felt that his sorrow was not the
            effect of his love to God. He knew that his sins deserved
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">some</span></em> punishment. His conscience,
            however weak, told him that he could not sin with perfect
            impunity, and that something more was needed than his perfunctory
            confession to a priest. He <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> felt that he must do <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">something</span></em>—fast, or go on a
            pilgrimage, or purchase an Indulgence. It was at this point that
            the Church intervened to show him how his poor performance could
            be transformed by the power of the Church and its treasury of
            merits into something so great that the penalties of Purgatory
            could be actually evaded. His cheap sorrow, his careless
            confession, need not trouble him. Hence, for the ordinary
            indifferent Christian, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Attrition</span></em>, <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Confession</span></em>, and <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Indulgence</span></em> became the three
            heads of the scheme of the Church for his salvation. The one
            thing that satisfied his conscience was the burdensome thing he
            had to do, and that was to procure an Indulgence—a matter made
            increasingly easy for him as time went on.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must not be
            supposed that this doctrine of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Attrition</span></em>, and its evident
            effect in deadening the conscience and in lowering the standard
            of morality, had the undivided support of the theologians of the
            later Middle Ages, but it was the doctrine taught by most of the
            Scotist theologians, who took the lead in theological thinking
            during these times. It was set forth in its most extravagant form
            by such a representative man as John of Paltz in Erfurt; it was
            preached by the pardon-sellers; it was eagerly welcomed by
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">indifferent</span></em> Christians, who
            desired to escape the penalties of sin without abandoning its
            enjoyments; it exalted the power of the priesthood; and it was
            specially valuable in securing good sales of Indulgences, and
            therefore in increasing the papal revenues. It lay at the basis
            of the whole theory and practice of Indulgences, which confronted
            Luther when he issued his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">History shows
            us that gross abuses had always gathered round the practice of
            Indulgences, even in their earlier and simpler forms. The priests
            had abused the system, and the power of issuing Indulgences had
            been taken from them and confined to the bishops. The bishops, in
            turn, had abused the privilege, and the Popes had gradually
            assumed that the power to grant an Indulgence belonged
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name=
            "Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to the Bishop of
            Rome exclusively, or to those to whom he might delegate it; and
            this assumption seemed both reasonable and salutary. The power
            was at first sparingly used. It is true that Pope Urban
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span>, in 1095, promised
            to the Crusaders an Indulgence such as had never before been
            heard of—a complete remission of all imposed canonical penances;
            but it was not until the thirteenth and fourteen centuries that
            Indulgences, now doubly dangerous to the moral life from the new
            theories which had arisen, were lavished even more unsparingly
            than in the days when any bishop had power to grant them. From
            the beginning of the fourteenth century they were given to raise
            recruits for papal wars. They were lavished on the religious
            Orders, either for the benefit of the members or for the purpose
            of attracting strangers and their gifts to their churches. They
            were bestowed on cathedrals and other churches, or on individual
            altars in churches, and had the effect of endowments. They were
            joined to special collections of relics, to be earned by the
            faithful who visited the shrines. They were given to hospitals,
            and for the upkeep of bridges and of roads. Wherever they are met
            with in the later Middle Ages, and it would be difficult to say
            where they are not to be found, they are seen to be associated
            with sordid money-getting, and, as Luther remarked in an early
            sermon on the subject, they were a very grievous instrument
            placed in the hand of avarice.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The practice
            of granting Indulgences was universally prevalent and was
            universally accepted; but it was not easy to give an explanation
            of the system, in the sense of showing that it was an essential
            element in Christian discipline. No mediæval theologian attempted
            to do any such thing. Bonaventura and Thomas Aquinas, the two
            great Schoolmen who did more than any others to provide a
            theological basis for the system, tell us quite frankly that it
            is their business to accept the fact that Indulgences do exist as
            part of the penitentiary discipline of the Church, and, accepting
            it, they thought themselves bound to construct a <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id=
            "Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> reasonable theory.<a id=
            "noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a> The
            practice altered, and new theories were needed to explain the
            variations. It is needless to say that these explanations did not
            always agree; and that there were very great differences of
            opinion about what an Indulgence really effected for the man who
            bought it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of all these
            disputed questions the most important was: Did an Indulgence give
            remission for the guilt of sin, or only for certain penalties
            which followed the sinful deed? This is a question about which
            modern Romanists are extremely sensitive.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The universal
            answer given by all defenders of Indulgences who have written on
            the subject since the Council of Trent, is that guilt
            (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">culpa</span></span>) and
            eternal punishment (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pœnæ
            eternæ</span></span>) are dealt with in the Sacrament of Penance,
            and that Indulgences relate only to temporal punishments,
            including under that designation the pains of Purgatory. This
            modern opinion is confirmed by the most eminent authorities of
            the mediæval Church. It has been accepted in the description of
            the theory of Indulgences given above, since it has been said
            that the principal use of Indulgences was to secure against
            Purgatory. But these statements do not exhaust the question.
            Mediæval theology did not create Indulgences, it only followed
            and tried to justify the practices of the Pope and of the Roman
            Curia,—a rather difficult task. The question still remains
            whether some of the Papal Bulls promulgating Indulgences did not
            promise the removal of guilt as well as security against temporal
            punishments. If these be examined, spurious Bulls being set
            aside, it will be found that many of them make no mention of the
            need of previous confession and of priestly absolution; that one
            or two expressly make mention of a remission of guilt as well as
            of penalty; and that many (especially those which proclaim
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name=
            "Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a Jubilee
            Indulgence) use language which inevitably led intelligent laymen
            like Dante to believe that the Popes did proclaim the remission
            of guilt as well as of penalty. Of course, it may be said that in
            those days the distinction between guilt (<span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">culpa</span></span>) and penalty
            (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">pœna</span></span>) had not
            been very exactly defined, and that the phrase <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">remission of
            sins</span></em> was used to denote both remission of guilt and
            remission of penalty; still it is difficult to withstand the
            conclusion that, even in theory, Indulgences had been declared to
            be efficacious for the removal of the guilt of sin in the
            presence of God.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
            questions of the theological meaning of an Indulgence, though
            necessary to understand the whole situation, had after all little
            to do with Luther's action. He approached the whole matter from
            the side of the practical effect of the proclamation of an
            Indulgence on the minds of common men who knew nothing of refined
            theological distinctions; and the evidence that the common people
            did generally believe that an Indulgence did remove the guilt of
            sin is overwhelming. Contemporary chroniclers are to be found who
            declare that Indulgences given to Crusaders remit the guilt as
            well as the punishment; contemporary preachers assert that
            plenary Indulgences remit guilt, and justify their opinion by
            declaring that such Indulgences were supposed to contain within
            them the Sacrament of Penance. The popular guide-books written
            for pilgrims to Rome and Compostella spread the popular idea that
            Indulgences acquired by such pilgrimages do remit guilt as well
            as penalty. The popular belief was so thoroughly acknowledged,
            that even Councils had to throw the blame for it on the
            pardon-sellers, or, like the Council of Constance, impeached the
            Pope and compelled him to confess that he had granted Indulgences
            for the remission of guilt as well as of penalty. This widespread
            popular belief of itself justified Luther in calling attention to
            this side of the matter.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, it
            is well to see what the theory of the most respected theologians
            actually meant when looked at <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> practically. Since the formulation of the
            Sacrament of Penance, the theory had been that all guilt of sin
            and all eternal punishment were remitted in the priestly
            absolution which followed the confession of the penitent. The
            Sacrament of Penance had abolished guilt and Hell. But there
            remained the actual sins to be punished, because the justice of
            God demanded it, and this was done in the temporal pains of
            Purgatory. The <span class="tei tei-q">“common man,”</span> if he
            thought at all about it, may be excused if he considered that
            guilt and Hell, taken away by the one hand, were restored by the
            other. There remained for him the sense that God's justice
            demanded <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">some</span></em> punishment for the sins he
            had committed; and if this was not guilt according to theological
            definition, it was probably all that he could attain to. He was
            taught and believed that punishment awaited him for these actual
            sins of his; and a punishment which might last thousands of years
            in Purgatory was not very different from an eternal punishment in
            his eyes. The Indulgence came to him filled as he was with these
            vague thoughts, and offered him a sure way of easing his
            conscience and avoiding the punishment he knew he deserved. He
            had only to pay the price of a <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Papal
            Ticket</span></span>, perform the canonical good deed required,
            whatever it might be, and he was assured that his punishment was
            remitted, and God's justice satisfied. This may not involve the
            thought of the remission of guilt in the theological sense of the
            word, but it certainly misled the moral instincts of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“common man”</span> about as much as if
            it did. It is not surprising that the common people made the
            theological mistake, if mistake it was, and saw in every plenary
            Indulgence the promise of the remission of guilt as well as of
            penalty,<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href=

            with them remission of guilt and quieting of conscience were one
            and the same thing. It was this practical moral effect of
            Indulgences, and not the theological explanation of the theory,
            which stirred Luther to make his protest.</p>

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span> are singularly unlike
            what might have been expected from a Professor of Theology. They
            lack theological definition, and contain many repetitions which
            might have been easily avoided. They are simply ninety-five
            sturdy strokes struck at a great ecclesiastical abuse which was
            searing the consciences of many. They look like the utterances of
            a man who was in close touch with the people; who had been
            greatly shocked at reports brought to him of what the
            pardon-sellers had said; who had read a good many of the
            theological explanations of the practice of Indulgence, and had
            noted down a few things which he desired to contradict. They read
            as if they were meant for laymen, and were addressed to their
            common sense of spiritual things. They are plain and easily
            understood, and keep within the field of simple religion and
            plain moral truths.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span> appealed irresistibly
            to all those who had been brought up in the simple evangelical
            faith which distinguished the quiet home life of so many German
            families, and who had not forsaken it. They also appealed to all
            who had begun to adopt that secular or non-ecclesiastical piety
            which, we have seen, had been spreading quietly but rapidly
            throughout Germany at the close of the Middle Ages. These two
            forces, both religious, gathered round Luther. The effect of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span> was almost immediate:
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name=
            "Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the desire to
            purchase Indulgences cooled, and the sales almost stopped.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            Ninety-five <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span> made six different
            assertions about Indulgences and their efficacy:</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">i. An
            Indulgence is and can only be the remission of a merely
            ecclesiastical penalty; the Church can remit what the Church has
            imposed; it cannot remit what God has imposed.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">ii. An
            Indulgence can never remit guilt; the Pope himself cannot do such
            a thing; God has kept that in His own hand.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">iii. It cannot
            remit the divine punishment for sin; that also is in the hands of
            God alone.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">iv. It can
            have no efficacy for souls in Purgatory; penalties imposed by the
            Church can only refer to the living; death dissolves them; what
            the Pope can do for souls in Purgatory is by prayer, not by
            jurisdiction or the power of the keys.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">v. The
            Christian who has true repentance has already received pardon
            from God altogether apart from an Indulgence, and does not need
            one; Christ demands this true repentance from every one.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">vi. The
            Treasury of Merits has never been properly defined, it is hard to
            say what it is, and it is not properly understood by the people;
            it cannot be the merits of Christ and of His saints, because
            these act of themselves and quite apart from the intervention of
            the Pope; it can mean nothing more than that the Pope, having the
            power of the keys, can remit ecclesiastical penalties imposed by
            the Church; the true Treasure-house of merits is the Holy Gospel
            of the grace and glory of God.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Archbishop
            of Mainz, finding that the publication of the <span class=

            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span> interfered with the
            sale of the Indulgences, sent a copy to Rome. Pope Leo, thinking
            that the whole thing was a monkish quarrel, contented himself
            with asking the General of the Augustinian Eremites to keep his
            monks quiet. Tetzel, in conjunction with a friend, Conrad
            Wimpina, published a set of counter-theses. John Mayr

            at Ingolstadt, by far the ablest opponent Luther ever had, wrote
            an answer to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a> and
            Luther replied in a tract with the title <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Asterisks</span></span>. At Rome, Silvester
            Mazzolini (1460-?) of Prierio, a Dominican monk, papal censor for
            the Roman Province and an Inquisitor, was profoundly dissatisfied
            with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Ninety-five Theses</span></span>, and
            proceeded to criticise them severely in a <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dialogue about the
            Power of the Pope; against the Presumptuous Conclusions of Martin
            Luther</span></span>. The book reached Germany by the middle of
            January 1518. The Augustinian Eremites held their usual annual
            chapter at Heidelberg in April 1518, and Luther heard his
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span> temperately discussed
            by his brother monks. He found the opposition to his views much
            stronger than he had expected; but the discussion was fair and
            honest, and Luther enjoyed it after the ominous silence kept by
            most of his friends, who had thought his action rash. When he
            returned from Heidelberg he began a general answer to his
            opponents. The book, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Resolutiones</span></span>, was probably the
            most carefully written of all Luther's writings. He thought long
            over it, weighed every statement carefully, and rewrote portions
            several times. The preface, addressed to his Vicar-General,
            Staupitz, contains some interesting autobiographical material; it
            was addressed to the Pope; it was a detailed defence of his
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span>.<a id="noteref_164"

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Ninety-five Theses</span></span> had a
            circulation which was, for the time, unprecedented. They were
            known throughout Germany in a little over a fortnight; they were
            read over Western Europe within four weeks <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“as if they had been circulated by angelic
            messengers,”</span> says Myconius enthusiastically. Luther was
            staggered at the way they were <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> received; he said that he had not meant to
            determine, but to debate. The controversy they awakened increased
            their popularity. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span>, and especially in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Resolutiones</span></span>, Luther had
            practically discarded all the practices which the Pope and the
            Roman Curia had introduced in the matter of Indulgences from the
            beginning of the thirteenth century, and all the ingenious
            explanations Scholastic theologians had brought forward to
            justify these practices. The readiest way to refute him was to
            assert the power of the Roman Bishop; and this was the line taken
            by his critics. Their arguments amount to this: the power to
            issue an Indulgence is simply a particular instance of the power
            of papal jurisdiction, and Indulgences are simply what the Pope
            proclaims them to be. Therefore, to attack Indulgences is to
            attack the power of the Pope, and that cannot be tolerated. The
            Roman Church is virtually the Universal Church, and the Pope is
            practically the Roman Church. Hence, as the representative of the
            Roman Church, which in turn represents the Church Universal, the
            Pope, when he acts officially, cannot err. Official decisions are
            given in actions as well as in words, custom has the force of
            law. Therefore, whoever objects to such a long-established system
            as Indulgences is a heretic, and does not deserve to be
            heard.<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href=
            "#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
            argument which appealed most powerfully to the Roman Curia was
            the fact that the sales of the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Papal
            Tickets</span></span> had been declining since the publication of
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span>. Indulgences were the
            source of an enormous revenue, and anything which checked their
            sale would cause financial embarrassment. Pope Leo <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">x.</span></span> in his <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“enjoyment of the Papacy”</span> lived lavishly. He
            had a huge income, much greater than that of any European
            monarch, but he lived beyond it. His income amounted to between
            four and five hundred thousand ducats; but he had spent seven
            hundred thousand on his war about the Duchy of Urbino; the
            magnificent reception of his brother Julian <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id=
            "Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and his bride in Rome (1514)
            had cost him fifty thousand ducats; and he had spent over three
            hundred thousand on the marriage of his nephew Lorenzo (1518).
            Voices had been heard in Rome as well as in Germany protesting
            against this extravagance. The Pope was in desperate need of
            money. It is scarcely to be wondered that Luther was summoned to
            Rome (summons dated July 1518, and received by Luther on August
            7th) to answer for his attack on the Indulgence system. To have
            obeyed would have meant death.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The peremptory
            summons could be construed as an affront to the University of
            Wittenberg, on whose boards the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ninety-five
            Theses</span></span> had been posted. Luther wrote to his friend
            Spalatin (George Burkhardt of Spalt, 1484-1545), who was chaplain
            and private secretary to the Elector Frederick, suggesting that
            the prince ought to defend the rights of his University. Spalatin
            wrote at once to the Elector and also to the Emperor Maximilian,
            and the result was that the summons to Rome was cancelled, and it
            was arranged that the matter was to be left in the hands of the
            Papal Legate in Germany, Thomas de Vio, Cardinal Cajetan<a id=
            "noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a>
            (1470-1553), and Luther was ordered to present himself before
            that official at Augsburg. The interview (October 1518) was not
            very satisfactory. The cardinal demanded that Luther should
            recant his heresies without any argument. When pressed to say
            what the heresies were, he named the statement in the 58th Thesis
            that the merits of Christ work effectually without the
            intervention of the Pope, and that in the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Resolutiones</span></span> which said that
            the sacraments are not efficacious apart from faith in the
            recipient. There was some discussion notwithstanding the Legate's
            declaration; but in the end Luther was ordered to recant or
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name=
            "Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> depart. He wrote
            out an appeal from the Pope ill-informed to the Pope
            well-informed, also an appeal to a General Council, and returned
            to Wittenberg.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Luther
            had posted his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span> on the doors of the
            Church of All Saints, he had been a solitary monk with nothing
            but his manhood to back him; but nine months had made a wonderful
            difference in the situation. He now knew that he was a
            representative man, with supporters to be numbered by the
            thousand. His colleagues at Wittenberg were with him; his
            students demonstratively loyal (they had been burning the
            Wimpina-Tetzel counter-theses); his theology was spreading among
            all the cloisters of his Order in Germany, and even in the
            Netherlands; and the rapid circulation of his <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span> had shown him that he
            had the ear of Germany. His first task, on his return to
            Wittenberg, was to prepare for the press an account of his
            interview with Cardinal Cajetan at Augsburg, and this was
            published under the title, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Acta Augustana</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther was at
            pains to take the people of Germany into his confidence; he
            published an account of every important interview he had; the
            people were able to follow him step by step, and he was never so
            far in advance that they were unable to see his footprints. The
            immediate effect of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Acta Augustana</span></span> was an immense
            amount of public sympathy for Luther. The people, even the
            Humanists who had cared little for the controversy, saw that an
            eminently pious man, an esteemed teacher who was making his
            obscure University famous, who had done nothing but propose a
            discussion on the notoriously intricate question of Indulgences,
            was peremptorily ordered to recant and remain silent. They could
            only infer that the Italians treated the Germans contemptuously,
            and wished simply to drain the country of money to be spent in
            the luxuries of the papal court. The Elector Frederick shared the
            common opinion, and was, besides, keenly alive to anything which
            touched his University and its prosperity. There is no evidence
            to show that he had much <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> sympathy with Luther's views. But the
            University of Wittenberg, the seat of learning he had founded, so
            long languishing with a very precarious life and now flourishing,
            was the apple of his eye; and he resolved to defend it, and to
            protect the teacher who had won renown for it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The political
            situation in Germany was too delicate, and the personal political
            influence of Frederick too great, for the Pope to act rashly in
            any matter in which that prince took a deep interest. The country
            was on the eve of an election of a King of the Romans; Maximilian
            was old, and an imperial election might occur at any time; and
            Frederick was one of the most important factors in either case.
            So the Pope resolved to act cautiously. The condemnation of
            Luther by the Cardinal-Legate was held over, and a special papal
            delegate was sent down to Germany to make inquiries. Every care
            was taken to select a man who would be likely to be acceptable to
            the Elector. Charles von Miltitz, a Saxon nobleman belonging to
            the Meisen district, a canon of Mainz, Trier, and Meissen, a
            papal chamberlain, an acquaintance of Spalatin's, the Elector's
            own agent at the Court of Rome, was sent to Germany. He took with
            him the <span class="tei tei-q">“Golden Rose”</span> as a token
            of the Pope's personal admiration for the Elector. He was
            furnished with numerous letters from His Holiness to the Elector,
            to some of the Saxon councillors, to the magistrates of
            Wittenberg, in all of which Luther figured as a child of the
            Devil. The phrase was probably forgotten when Leo wrote to Luther
            some time afterwards and called him his dear son.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Miltitz
            got among German speaking people he found that the state of
            matters was undreamt of at the papal court. He was a German, and
            knew the Germans. He could see, what the Cardinal-Legate had
            never perceived, that he had to deal not with the stubbornness of
            a recalcitrant monk, but with the slow movement of a nation. When
            he visited his friends and relations in Augsburg and Nürnberg, he
            found that three out of five were on Luther's side. He came to
            the wise resolution that he would see <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> both Luther and Tetzel privately before
            producing his credentials. Tetzel he could not see. The unhappy
            man wrote to Miltitz that he dared not stir from his convent, so
            greatly was he in danger from the violence of the people. Miltitz
            met Luther in the house of Spalatin; he at once disowned the
            speeches of the pardon-sellers; he let it be seen that he did not
            think much of the Cardinal-Legate's methods of action; he so
            prevailed on Luther that the latter promised to write a
            submissive letter to the Pope, to advise people to reverence the
            Roman See, to say that Indulgences were useful in the remission
            of canonical penances. Luther did all this; and if the Roman
            Curia had supported Miltitz there is no saying how far the
            reconciliation would have gone. But the Roman Curia did not
            support the papal chamberlain, and Miltitz had also to reckon
            with John Eck, who was burning to extinguish Luther in a public
            discussion.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The months
            between his interview at Augsburg (October 1518) and the
            Disputation with John Eck at Leipzig (June 1519) had been spent
            by Luther in hard and disquieting studies. His opponents had
            confronted him with the Pope's absolute supremacy in all
            ecclesiastical matters. This was one of Luther's oldest inherited
            beliefs. The Church had been for him <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            Pope's House,”</span> in which the Pope was the house-father, to
            whom all obedience was due. It was hard for him to think
            otherwise. He had been re-examining his convictions about
            justifying faith and attempting to trace clearly their
            consequences, and whether they did lead to his declarations about
            the efficacy of Indulgences. He could come to no other
            conclusion. It became necessary to investigate the evidence for
            the papal claim to absolute authority. He began to study the
            Decretals, and found, to his amazement and indignation, that they
            were full of frauds; and that the papal supremacy had been forced
            on Germany on the strength of a collection of Decretals many of
            which were plainly forgeries. It is difficult to say whether the
            discovery brought more joy or more grief to Luther. Under the
            combined <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg
            236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            influences of historical study, of the opinions of the early
            Church Fathers, and of the Holy Scriptures, one of his oldest
            landmarks was crumbling to pieces. His mind was in a whirl of
            doubt. He was half-exultant and half-terrified at the result of
            his studies; and his correspondence reveals how his mood of mind
            changed from week to week. It was while he was thus <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“on the swither,”</span> tremulously on the balance,
            that John Eck challenged him to dispute at Leipzig on the primacy
            and supremacy of the Roman Pontiff. The discussion might clear
            the air, might make himself see where he stood. He accepted the
            challenge almost feverishly.</p>

            enemies' country, and his Wittenberg friends would not allow
            Luther to go there unaccompanied. The young Duke Barnim, who was
            Rector of the University of Wittenberg, accompanied Carlstadt and
            Luther, to give them the protection of his presence. Melanchthon,
            who had been a member of the teaching staff of Wittenberg since
            August 1518, Justus Jonas, and Nicholas Amsdorf went along with
            them. Two hundred Wittenberg students in helmets and halberts
            formed a guard, and walked beside the two country carts which
            carried their professors. An eye-witness of the scenes at Leipzig
            has left us sketches of what he saw:</p>

            that the host had to restrain him with a halbert to make him keep

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far as the
            dialectic battle was concerned, Eck had been victorious. He had
            done what he had meant to do. He had made Luther declare himself.
            All that was now needed was a Papal Bull against Luther, and the
            world would be rid of another pestilent heretic. He had done what
            the more politic Miltitz had wished to avoid. He had concentrated
            the attention of Germany on Luther, and had made him the central
            figure round which all the smouldering discontent could gather.
            As for Luther, he returned to Wittenberg full of melancholy
            forebodings. They did not prevent him preparing and publishing
            for the German people an account of the Disputation, which
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name=
            "Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was eagerly read.
            His arguments had been historical rather than theological. He
            tried to show that the acknowledgment of the supremacy of the
            Bishop of Rome was barely four hundred years old in Western
            Europe, and that it did not exist in the East. The Greek Church,
            he said, was part of the Church of Christ, and it would have
            nothing to do with the Pope; the great Councils of the Early
            Christian centuries knew nothing about papal supremacy.
            Athanasius, Basil, the Gregories, Cyprian himself, had all taken
            Luther's own position, and were heretics, according to Eck.
            Luther's speeches at Leipzig laid the foundation of that modern
            historical criticism of institutions which has gone so far in our
            own days.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In some
            respects the Leipzig Disputation was the most important point in
            the career of Luther. It made him see for the first time what lay
            in his opposition to Indulgences. It made the people see it also.
            His attack was no criticism, as he had at first thought, of a
            mere excrescence on the mediæval ecclesiastical system. He had
            struck at its centre; at its ideas of a priestly mediation which
            denied the right of every believer to immediate entrance into the
            very presence of God. It was after the Disputation at Leipzig
            that the younger German Humanists rallied round Luther to a man;
            that the burghers saw that religion and opposition to priestly
            tyranny were not opposite things; and that there was room for an
            honest attempt to create a Germany for the Germans independent of
            Rome. Luther found himself a new man after Leipzig, with a new
            freedom and wider sympathies. His depression fled. Sermons,
            pamphlets, letters from his tireless pen flooded the land, and
            were read eagerly by all classes of the population.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Three Great Reformation
            Treatises</span></span>, and the title befits them well. They
            were all written during the year 1520, after three years spent in
            controversy, at a time when Luther felt that he had completely
            broken from Rome, and when he knew that he had nothing to expect
            from Rome but a sentence of excommunication. His teaching may
            have varied in details afterwards, but in all essential positions
            it remained what is to be found in these books.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tract on
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
            Liberty of a Christian Man</span></span>, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“a very small book so far as the paper is
            concerned,”</span> said Luther, <span class="tei tei-q">“but one
            containing the whole sum of the Christian life,”</span> had a
            somewhat pathetic history. Miltitz, hoping against hope that the
            Pope would not push things to extremities, had asked Luther to
            write out a short summary of his inmost beliefs and send it to
            His Holiness. Luther consented, and this little volume was the
            result. It has for preface Luther's letter to Pope Leo
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">x.</span></span>, which concludes
            thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“I, in my poverty, have no other
            present to make you, nor do you need to be enriched by anything
            but a spiritual gift.”</span> It was probably the last of the
            three published (Oct. 1520), but it contains the principles which
            underlie the other two.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The booklet is
            a brief statement, free from all theological subtleties, of the
            priesthood of all believers which is a consequence of the fact of
            justification by faith alone. Its note of warning to Rome, and
            its educational value for pious people in the sixteenth century,
            consisted in its showing that the man who fears God and trusts in
            Him need not fear the priests nor the Church. The first part
            proves that every spiritual possession which a man has or can
            have must be traced back to his faith; if he has faith, he has
            all; if he has not faith, he has nothing. It is the possession of
            faith which gives liberty to a Christian man; God is with him,
            who can be against him?</p>

              an injustice has been done, since they have been transferred
              from the remaining body of Christians to those few who are now,
              by a hurtful custom, called ecclesiastics. For the Holy
              Scripture makes no distinction between them, except that those
              who are now boastfully called Popes, Bishops, and Lords, it
              calls ministers, servants, and stewards, who are to serve the
              rest in the ministry of the Word, for teaching the faith of
              Christ and the liberty of believers. For though it is true that
              we are all equally priests, yet cannot we, nor ought we if we
              could, all to minister and teach publicly.</span><span style=
              "font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
            part shows that everything that a Christian man does must come
            from his faith. It may be necessary to use all the ceremonies of
            divine service which past generations have found useful to
            promote the religious life; perhaps to fast and practise
            mortifications of the flesh; but if such things are to be really
            profitable, they must be kept in their proper place. They are
            good deeds not in the sense of making a man good, but as the
            signs of his faith; they are to be practised with joy because
            they are done for the sake of the God who has united Himself with
            man through Jesus Christ.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing that
            Luther has written more clearly manifests that combination of
            revolutionary daring and wise conservatism which was
            characteristic of the man. There is no attempt to sweep away any
            ecclesiastical machinery, provided only it be kept in its proper
            place as a means to an end. But religious ceremonies are not an
            end in themselves; and if through human corruption and neglect of
            the plain precepts of God's word they hinder instead of help the
            true growth of the soul, they ought to be swept away; and the
            fact that the soul of man needs absolutely nothing in the last
            resort but the word of God dwelling in him, gives men courage and
            calmness in demanding their reformation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther applied
            those principles to the reformation of the Church in his book on
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Babylonian Captivity of the
            Church</span></span> (Sept.-Oct. 1520). He subjected the
            elaborate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg
            242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            sacramental system of the Church to a searching criticism, and
            concluded that there are only two, or perhaps three, scriptural
            sacraments—the Eucharist, Baptism, and Penance. He denounced the
            doctrine of Transubstantiation as a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“monstrous phantom”</span> which the Church of the
            first twelve centuries knew nothing about, and said that any
            endeavour to define the precise manner of Christ's Presence in
            the sacrament is simply indecent curiosity. Perhaps the most
            important practical portion of the book deals with the topic of
            Christian marriage. In no sphere of human life has the Roman
            Church done more harm by interfering with simple scriptural
            directions:</p>

            <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
            "font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">What shall
            we say of those impious human laws by which this divinely
            appointed manner of life has been entangled and tossed up and
            down? Good God! it is horrible to look upon the temerity of the
            tyrants of Rome, who thus, according to their caprices, at one
            time annul marriages and at another time enforce them. Is the
            human race given over to their caprice for nothing but to be
            mocked and abused in every way, that these men may do what they
            please with it for the sake of their own fatal gains? ... And
            what do they sell? The shame of men and women, a merchandise
            worthy of these traffickers, who surpass all that is most sordid
            and most disgusting in their avarice and
            impiety.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther points
            out that there is a clear scriptural law on the degrees within
            which marriage is unlawful, and says that no human regulations
            ought to forbid marriages outside these degrees or permit them
            within. He also comes to the conclusion that divorce <span lang=
            "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">a mensa et thoro</span></span> is clearly
            permitted in Scripture; though he says that personally he hates
            divorce, and <span class="tei tei-q">“prefers bigamy to
            it.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The appeal
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">To the
            Christian Nobility of the German Nation</span></span> made the
            greatest immediate impression. It was written in haste, but must
            have been long thought over. Luther began the introduction on
            June 23rd (1520); the book was ready by the middle of August; and
            by the 18th, four thousand copies were in circulation throughout
            Germany, and the presses could not print fast enough for the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name=
            "Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> demand. It was a
            call to all Germany to unite against Rome.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was nobly
            comprehensive: it grasped the whole situation, and summed up with
            vigour and clearness all the German grievances which had hitherto
            been stated separately and weakly; it brought forward every
            partial proposal of reform, however incomplete, and quickened it
            by setting it in its proper place in one combined scheme. All the
            parts were welded together by a simple and courageous faith, and
            made living by the moral earnestness which pervaded the
            whole.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther struck
            directly at the imaginary mysterious semi-supernatural power
            supposed to belong to the Church and the priesthood which had
            held Europe in awed submission for so many centuries. Reform had
            been impossible, the appeal said, because the walls behind which
            Rome lay entrenched had been left standing—walls of straw and
            paper, but in appearance formidable. These sham fortifications
            are: the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Spiritual Power</span></em> which is
            believed to be superior to the temporal power of kings and
            princes, the conception that <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no one can
            interpret Scripture but the Pope</span></em>, the idea that
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no one
            can summon a General Council but the Bishop of Rome</span></em>.
            These are the threefold lines of fortification behind which the
            Roman Curia has entrenched itself, and the German people has long
            believed that they are impregnable. Luther sets to work to
            demolish them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Romanists
            assert that the Pope, bishops, priests, and monks belong to and
            constitute the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">spiritual estate</span></em>, while princes,
            lords, artisans, and peasants are the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">temporal
            estate</span></em>, which is subject to the spiritual. But this
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">spiritual estate</span></em> is a mere
            delusion. The real <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">spiritual estate</span></em> is the whole
            body of believers in Jesus Christ, and they are spiritual because
            Jesus has made all His followers priests to God and to His
            Christ. A cobbler belongs to the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritual
            estate</span></em> as truly as a bishop. The clergy are
            distinguished from the laity not by an indelible character
            imposed upon them in a divine mystery called ordination, but
            because they have been set apart to do a particular <span class=

            "Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> kind of work in the
            commonwealth. If a Pope, bishop, priest, or monk neglects to do
            the work he is there to do, he deserves to be punished as much as
            a careless mason or tailor, and is as accountable to the civil
            authorities. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">spiritual priesthood of all
            believers</span></em>, the gift of the faith which justifies, has
            shattered the first and most formidable of these papal
            fortifications.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is foolish
            to say that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            Church; and if the Pope offends, and he often does, we can only
            obey Scripture by calling a Council. Every individual Christian
            has a right to do his best to have it summoned; the temporal
            powers are there to enforce his wishes; Emperors called General
            Councils in the earlier ages of the Church.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The straw and
            paper walls having been thus cleared away, Luther proceeds to
            state his indictment. There is in Rome one who calls himself the
            Vicar of Christ, and who lives in a state of singular resemblance
            to our Lord and to St. Peter, His apostle. For this man wears a
            triple crown (a single one does not content him), and keeps up
            such a state that he needs a larger personal revenue than the
            Emperor. He has surrounding him a number of men, called
            cardinals, whose only apparent use is that they serve to draw to
            themselves the revenues of the richest <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> convents, endowments, and benefices in
            Europe, and spend the money thus obtained in keeping up the state
            of a great monarch in Rome. When it is impossible to seize the
            whole revenue of an ecclesiastical benefice, the Curia joins some
            ten or twenty together, and mulcts each in a good round sum for
            the benefit of the cardinal. Thus the priory of Würzburg gives
            one thousand gulden yearly, and Bamberg, Mainz, and Trier pay
            their quotas. The papal court is enormous,—three thousand papal
            secretaries, and hangers-on innumerable; and all are waiting for
            German benefices, whose duties they never fulfil, as wolves wait
            for a flock of sheep. Germany pays more to the Curia than it
            gives to its own Emperor. Then look at the way Rome robs the
            whole German land. Long ago the Emperor permitted the Pope to
            take the half of the first year's income from every benefice—the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Annates</span></span>—to provide for a war
            against the Turks. The money was never spent for the purpose
            destined; yet it has been regularly paid for a hundred years, and
            the Pope demands it as a regular and legitimate tax, and uses it
            to pay posts and offices at Rome.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Bull,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exurge
            Domine</span></span>, was scarcely worthy of the occasion. The
            Pope seems to have left its construction in the hands of
            Prierias, Cajetan, and Eck, and the contents seem to show that
            Eck had the largest share in framing it. Much of it reads like an
            echo of Eck's statements at Leipzig a year before. It began
            pathetically: <span class="tei tei-q">“Arise, O Lord, plead Thine
            own cause; remember how the foolish man reproacheth Thee daily;
            the foxes are wasting Thy vineyard, which Thou hast given to Thy
            Vicar Peter; the boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild
            beast of the field doth devour it.”</span> St. Peter is invoked,
            and the Pope's distress at the news of Luther's misdeeds is
            described at length. The most disturbing thing is that the errors
            of the Greeks and of the Bohemians were being revived, and that
            in Germany, which had hitherto been so faithful to the Holy See.
            Then came forty-one propositions, said to be Luther's, which are
            condemned as <span class="tei tei-q">“heretical or scandalous, or
            false or offensive to pious ears, or seducing to simple minds,
            and standing in the way of the Catholic <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a> All
            faithful people were ordered to burn Luther's books wherever they
            could find them. Luther himself had refused to come to Rome and
            submit to instruction; he had even appealed to a General Council,
            contrary to the decrees of Julius <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span> and Pius
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span>; he was therefore
            inhibited from preaching; he and all who followed him were
            ordered to make public recantation within sixty days; if they did
            not, they were to be treated as heretics, were to be seized and
            imprisoned by the magistrates, and all towns or districts which
            sheltered them were to be placed under an interdict.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
            forty-one propositions condemned was one—that the burning of
            heretics was a sin against the Spirit of Christ—to which the Pope
            seemed to attach special significance, so often did he repeat it
            in letters to the Elector Frederick and other authorities in
            Germany. The others may be arranged in four classes—against
            Luther's opinions about Indulgences; his statements about
            Purgatory; his declarations that the efficacy of the sacraments
            depended upon the spiritual condition of those who received them;
            that penance was an outward sign of sorrow, and that good works
            (ecclesiastical and moral) were to be regarded as the signs of
            faith rather than as making men actually righteous; his denial of
            the later <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">curial</span></em> assertions of the nature
            of the papal monarchy over the Church. Luther's opinions on all
            these points could be supported by abundant testimony from the
            earlier ages of the Church, and most of his criticisms were
            directed against theories which had not been introduced before
            the middle of the thirteenth century. The Bull made no attempt to
            argue about the truth of the positions taken in its sentences.
            There was nothing done to show that Luther's opinions were wrong.
            The one dominant note running all through the papal deliverance
            was the simple assertion of the Pope's right to order any
            discussion to cease at his command.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This did not
            help to commend the Bull to the people of Germany, and was

            publishing it in Germany was still less calculated to win respect
            for its decisions. The publication was entrusted to John Eck of
            Ingolstadt, who was universally recognised as Luther's personal
            enemy; and the hitherto unheard of liberty was granted to him to
            insert at his pleasure the names of a certain number of persons,
            and to summon them to appear before the Roman Curia. He showed
            how unfit he was for this responsible task by inserting the names
            of men who had criticised or satirised him—Adelmann, Pirkheimer,
            Carlstadt, and three others.<a id="noteref_173" name=

            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eck discovered
            that it was an easier matter to get permission from the Roman
            Curia to frame a Bull against the man who had stopped the sale of
            Indulgences, and was drying up a great source of revenue, than to
            publish the Bull in Germany. It was thought at Rome that no man
            had more influence among the bishops and Universities, but the
            Curia soon learnt that it had made a mistake. The Universities
            stood upon their privileges, and would have nothing to do with
            John Eck. The bishops made all manner of technical objections.
            Many persons affected to believe that the Bull was not authentic;
            and Luther himself did not disdain to take this line in his
            tract, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Against the Execrable Bull of
            Antichrist</span></span>. Eck, who had come down to Germany
            inflated with vanity, found himself mocked and scorned.
            Pirkheimer dubbed him <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">gehobelter
            Eck</span></span>, Eck with the swelled head, and the epithet
            stuck. Nor was the publication any easier when the pretence of
            unauthenticity could be maintained no longer. The University of
            Wittenberg refused to publish the Bull, <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> on the ground that the Pope would not have
            permitted its issue had he known the true state of matters, and
            they blamed Eck for misinforming His Holiness: the Council of
            Electoral Saxony agreed with the Senate; and their action was
            generally commended. Spalatin said that he had seen at least
            thirty letters from great princes and learned men of all
            districts in Germany, from Pomerania to Switzerland, and from the
            Breisgau to Bohemia, encouraging Luther to stand firm. Eck
            implored the bishops of the dioceses surrounding
            Wittenberg—Merseburg, Meissen, and Brandenburg—to publish the
            Bull. They were either unwilling or powerless.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther had
            been expecting a Bull against him ever since the Leipzig
            Disputation. His correspondence reveals that he met it
            undismayed. What harm could a papal Bull do to a man whose faith
            had given him fellowship with God? What truth could there be in a
            Bull which clearly contradicted the Holy Scriptures? St. Paul has
            warned us against believing an angel from heaven if he uttered
            words different from the Scriptures, which are our strength and
            our consolation; why should we pin our faith to a Pope or a
            Council? The Bull had done one thing for him, it had made him an
            excommunicated man, and therefore had freed him from his monastic
            vows. He could leave the convent when he liked, only he did not
            choose to do so. When he heard that his writings had been burnt
            as heretical by order of the Papal Legates, he resolved to
            retaliate. It was no sudden decision. Eleven months previously he
            had assured Spalatin (January 1520) that if Rome condemned and
            burnt his writings he would condemn and burn the papal Decretal
            Laws. On December 10th (1520) he posted a notice inviting the
            Wittenberg students to witness the burning of the papal
            Constitutions and the books of Scholastic Theology at nine
            o'clock in the morning.<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174"

            burghers, and professors met in the open space outside the Elster
            Gate between the walls and the river Elbe. A great bonfire had
            been built. An oak tree planted long ago still marks the spot.
            One of the professors kindled the pile; Luther laid the books of
            the Decretals on the glowing mass, and they caught the flames;
            then amid solemn silence he placed a copy of the Bull on the
            fire, saying in Latin: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">As thou hast wasted with anxiety the Holy
            One of God, so may the eternal flames waste thee</span></em>
            (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quia tu conturbasti Sanctum
            Domini, ideoque te conturbet ignis eternus</span></span>). He
            waited till the paper was consumed, and then with his friends and
            fellow-professors he went back to the town. Some hundreds of
            students remained standing round the fire. For a while they were
            sobered by the solemnity of the occasion and sang the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Te
            Deum</span></span>. Then a spirit of mischief seized them, and
            they began singing funeral dirges in honour of the burnt
            Decretals. They got a peasant's cart, fixed in it a pole on which
            they hung a six-foot-long banner emblazoned with the Bull, piled
            the small cart with the books of Eck, Emser, and other Romish
            controversialists, hauled it along the streets and out through
            the Elster Gate, and, throwing books and Bull on the glowing
            embers of the bonfire, they burnt them. Sobered again, they sang
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Te
            Deum</span></span> and finally dispersed.</p>

            Bulls had been burnt before Luther's days, but the burners had
            been for the most part powerful monarchs. This tune it was done
            by a monk, with nothing but his courageous faith to back him. It

            classes of the people was gathering round him.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            representatives of foreign States who were present at the Diet of
            Worms, of England, Spain, and Venice, all wrote home to their
            respective governments about the extraordinary popularity which
            Luther enjoyed among almost every class of his fellow-countrymen;
            and, as we shall see, the despatches of Aleander, the papal
            nuncio at the Diet, are full of statements and complaints which
            confirm these reports. This popularity had been growing since
            1517, and there are traces that many thoughtful men had been
            attracted to Luther some years earlier. The accounts of Luther's
            interview with Cardinal Cajetan at Augsburg, and his attitude at
            the Leipzig Disputation, had given a great impulse to the
            veneration with which people regarded him; but the veneration
            itself had been quietly growing, apart from any striking
            incidents in his career. The evidence for what follows has been
            collected chiefly from such private correspondence as has
            descended to us; and most stress has been laid on letters which
            were not addressed to Luther, and which were never meant to be
            seen by him. Men wrote to each other about him, and described the
            impression he was making on themselves and on the immediate
            circle of their acquaintances. We learn from such letters not
            merely the fact of the esteem, but what were the characteristics
            in the man which called it forth.<a id="noteref_175" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A large part
            of the evidence comes from the correspondence of educated men,
            who, if they were not all <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            that increasing class on whom the New Learning had made a great
            impression, and had produced the characteristic habit of mind
            which belonged to its possessors. The attitude and work of
            Erasmus had prepared them to appreciate Luther. The monkish
            opponents of the great Humanist had been thoroughly in the right
            when they feared the effects of his revolutionary ways of
            thinking, however they might be accompanied with appeals against
            all revolutionary action. He had exhibited his idea of what a
            life of personal religion ought to be in his <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Enchiridion</span></span>; he had exposed
            the mingled Judaism and paganism of a great part of the popular
            religion; he had poured scorn on the trifling subtleties of
            scholastic theology, and had asked men to return to a simple
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian Philosophy”</span>; above all,
            he had insisted that Christianity could only renew its youth by
            going back to the study of the Holy Scriptures, and especially of
            the New Testament; and he had aided his contemporaries to make
            this return by his edition of the New Testament, and by his
            efforts to bring within their reach the writings of the earlier
            Church Fathers. His Humanist followers in Germany believed that
            they saw in Luther a man who was doing what their leader urged
            all men to do. They saw in Luther an Erasmus, who was going to
            the root of things. He was rejecting with increasing
            determination the bewildering sophistries of Scholasticism, and,
            what was more, he was showing how many of these had arisen by
            exalting the authority of the pagan Aristotle over that of St.
            Paul and St. Augustine. He had painfully studied these Schoolmen,
            and could speak with an authority on this matter; for he was a
            learned theologian. The reports of his lectures, which were
            spreading throughout Germany, informed them that he based his
            teaching on a simple exposition of the Holy Scriptures in the
            Vulgate version, which was sanctioned by the mediæval Church. He
            had revolted, and was increasingly in revolt, against those
            abuses in the ordinary religious life which were encouraged from
            sordid motives by the Roman Curia,—abuses which <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id=
            "Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Erasmus had pierced through
            and through with the light darts of his sarcasm; and Luther knew,
            as Erasmus did not, what he was speaking about, for he had
            surrendered himself to that popular religion, and had sought in
            it desperately for a means of reconciliation with God without
            succeeding in his quest. They saw him insisting, with a
            strenuousness no Humanist had exhibited, on the Humanist demand
            that every man had a right to stand true to his own personal
            conscientious convictions. If some of them, like Erasmus, in
            spite of their scorn of monkery, still believed that the highest
            type of the religious life was a sincere self-sacrificing
            Franciscan monk, they saw their ideal in the Augustinian Eremite,
            whose life had never been stained by any monkish scandal, and who
            had been proclaimed by his brother monks to be a model of
            personal holiness. They were sure that when he pled heroically
            for the freedom of the religious life, his courage, which they
            could not emulate, rested on a depth and strength of personal
            piety which they sadly confessed they themselves did not possess.
            If they complained at times that Luther spoke too strongly
            against the Pope, they admitted that he was going to the root of
            things in his attack. All clear-sighted men perceived that the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">one</span></em> obstacle to reform was the
            theory of the papal monarchy, which had been laboriously
            constructed by Italian canonists after the failure of Conciliar
            reform,—a theory which defied the old mediæval ecclesiastical
            tradition, and contradicted the solemn decisions of the great
            German Councils of Constance and Basel. Luther's attacks on the
            Papacy were not stronger than those of Gerson and d'Ailly, and
            his language was not more unmeasured than that of their common
            master, William of Occam. There was nothing in these early days
            to prevent men who were genuinely attached to the mediæval
            Church, its older theology and its ancient rites, from rallying
            round Luther. When the marches began to be redd, and the
            beginnings of a Protestant Church confronted the mediæval, the
            situation was changed. Many who had enthusiastically supported
            Luther left him.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Conrad
            Mutianus, canon of Gotha, and the veteran leader of the Erfurt
            circle of Humanists, wrote admiringly of the originality of
            Luther's sermons as early as 1515. He applauded the stand he took
            at Leipzig, and spoke of him as <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Martinum, Deo devotissimum
            doctorem</span></span>. His followers were no longer contented
            with a study of the classical authors. Eobanus Hessus, crowned
            <span class="tei tei-q">“poet-king”</span> of Germany, abandoned
            his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Horace</span></span> for the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Enchiridion</span></span> of Erasmus and the
            Holy Scriptures. Justus Jonas (Jodocus Koch of Nordlingen)
            forsook classical Greek to busy himself with the Epistles to the
            Corinthians. The wicked satirist, Curicius Cordus, betook himself
            to the New Testament. They did this out of admiration for
            Erasmus, <span class="tei tei-q">“their father in Christ.”</span>
            But when Luther appeared, when they read his pamphlets
            circulating through Germany, when they followed, step by step,
            his career, they came under the influence of a new spell. The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Erasmici</span></span>, to use the phrases
            of the times, diminished, and the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Martiniani</span></span> increased in
            numbers. One of the old Erfurt circle, Johannes Crotus Rubeanus,
            was in Rome. His letters, passed round among his friends, made no
            small impression upon them. He told them that he was living in
            the centre of the plague-spot of Europe. He reviled the Curia as
            devoid of all moral conscience. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Pope
            and his carrion-crows”</span> were sitting content, gorged on the
            miseries of the Church. When Crotus received from Germany copies
            of Luther's writings, he distributed them secretly to his Italian
            friends, and collected their opinions to transmit to Germany.
            They were all sympathetically impressed with what Luther said,
            but they pitied him as a man travelling along a very dangerous
            road; no real reform was possible without the destruction of the
            whole curial system, and that was too powerful for any man to
            combat. Yet Luther was a hero; he was the <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Pater Patriæ</span></span> of Germany; his
            countrymen ought to erect a golden statue in his honour; they
            wished him God-speed. When Crotus returned to Germany and got
            more in touch with Luther's work, he felt more drawn to the
            Reformer, and wrote enthusiastically to his friends <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id=
            "Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that Luther was the personal
            revelation of Christ in modern times. So we find these Humanists
            declaring that Luther was the St. Paul of the age, the modern
            Hercules, the Achilles of the sixteenth century.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No Humanist
            circle gave Luther more enthusiastic support than that of
            Nürnberg. The soil had been prepared by a few ardent admirers of
            Staupitz, at the head of whom was Wenceslas Link, prior of the
            Augustinian-Eremites in Nürnberg, and a celebrated preacher. They
            had learned from Staupitz that blending of the theology of
            Augustine with the later German mysticism which was
            characteristic of the man, and it prepared them to appreciate the
            deeper experimental teaching of Luther. Among these Nürnberg
            Humanists was Christopher Scheurl, a jurist, personally
            acquainted with Luther and with Eck. The shortlived friendship
            between the two antagonists had been brought about by Scheurl,
            whose correspondence with Luther began in 1516. Scheurl was
            convinced that Luther's cause was the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“cause of God.”</span> He told Eck this. He wrote to
            him (February 18th, 1519) that all the most spiritually minded
            clergymen that he knew were devoted to Luther; that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“they flew to him in dense troops, like
            starlings”</span>; that their deepest sympathies were with him;
            and that they confessed that their holiest desires were prompted
            by his writings. Albert Dürer expressed his admiration by
            painting Luther as St. John, the beloved disciple of the Lord.
            Caspar Nützel, one of the most dignified officials of the town,
            thought it an honour to translate Luther's <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ninety-five
            Theses</span></span> into German. Lazarus Sprengel delighted to
            tell his friends how Luther's tracts and sermons were bringing
            back to a living Christianity numbers of his acquaintances who
            had been perplexed and driven from the faith by the trivialities
            common in ordinary sermons. Similar enthusiasm showed itself in
            Augsburg and other towns. After the Leipzig Disputation, the
            great printer of Basel, Frobenius, became an ardent admirer of
            Luther; reprinted most of his writings, and despatched them to
            Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, Italy, <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id=
            "Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> England, and Spain. He
            delighted to tell of the favourable reception they met with in
            these foreign countries,—how they had been welcomed by Lefèvre in
            France, and how the Swiss Cardinal von Sitten had said that
            Luther deserved all honour, for he spoke the truth, which no
            special pleading of an Eck could overthrow. The distinguished
            jurist Ulrich Zasius of Freiburg said that Luther was an
            <span class="tei tei-q">“angel incarnate,”</span> and while he
            deprecated his strong language against the Pope, he called him
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Phœnix among Christian
            theologians,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“flower of the
            Christian world,”</span> and the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“instrument of God.”</span> Zasius was a man whose
            whole religious sympathies belonged to the mediæval conception of
            the Church, yet he spoke of Luther in this way.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is perhaps
            difficult for us now to comprehend the state of mind which longed
            for the new and yet clung to the old, which made the two Nürnberg
            families, the Ebners and the Nützlers, season the ceremonies at
            their family gathering to celebrate their daughters taking the
            veil with speeches in praise of Luther and of his writings. Yet
            this was the dominant note in the vast majority of the supporters
            of Luther in these earlier years.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Men who had no
            great admiration for Luther personally had no wish to see him
            crushed by the Roman Curia by mere weight of authority. Even Duke
            George of Saxony, who had called Luther a pestilent fellow at the
            Leipzig Disputation, had been stirred into momentary admiration
            by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Address to the Christian Nobility of the
            German Nation</span></span>, and had no great desire to publish
            the Bull within his dominions; and his private secretary and
            chaplain, Jerome Emser, although a personal enemy who never lost
            an opportunity of controverting Luther, nevertheless hoped that
            he might be the instrument of effecting a reformation in the
            Church. Jacob Wimpheling of Strassburg, a thoroughgoing
            mediævalist who had manifested no sympathy for Reuchlin, and his
            friend Christopher of Utenheim, Bishop of Basel, hoped that the
            movement begun by Luther might lead to that reformation of the
            Church on mediæval lines which they both earnestly
            desired.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg
            258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps no one
            represented better the attitude of the large majority of Luther's
            supporters, in the years between 1517 and 1521, than did the
            Prince, who is rightly called Luther's protector, Frederick the
            Elector of Saxony. It is a great though common mistake to suppose
            that Frederick shared those opinions of Luther which afterwards
            grew to be the Lutheran theology. His brother John, and in a
            still higher degree his nephew John Frederick, were devoted
            Lutherans in the theological sense; but there is no evidence to
            show that Frederick ever was.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Frederick
            never had any intimate personal relations with Luther. At
            Spalatin's request, he had paid the expenses of Luther's
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">promotion</span></em> to the degree of
            Doctor of the Holy Scriptures; he had, of course, acquiesced in
            his appointment to succeed Spalatin as Professor of Theology; and
            he must have appreciated keenly the way in which Luther's work
            had gradually raised the small and declining University to the
            position it held in 1517. A few letters were exchanged between
            Luther and Frederick, but there is no evidence that they ever met
            in conversation; nor is there any that Frederick had ever heard
            Luther preach. When he lay dying he asked Luther to come and see
            him; but the Reformer was far distant, trying to dissuade the
            peasants from rising in rebellion, and when he reached the palace
            his old protector had breathed his last.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Elector
            was a pious man according to mediæval standards. He had received
            his earliest lasting religious impressions from intercourse with
            Augustinian Eremite monks when he was a boy at school at Grimma,
            and he maintained the closest relations with the Order all his
            life. He valued highly all the external aids to a religious life
            which the mediæval Church had provided. He believed in the virtue
            of pilgrimages and relics. He had made a pilgrimage to the Holy
            Land, and had brought back a great many relics, which he had
            placed in the Church of All Saints in Wittenberg, and he had
            agents at Venice and other Mediterranean ports commissioned to
            secure other relics for his collection. He continued to purchase
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name=
            "Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> them as late as
            the year 1523. He believed in Indulgences of the older
            type,—Indulgences which remitted in whole or in part
            ecclesiastically imposed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">satisfactions</span></em>,—and he had
            procured two for use in Saxony. One served as an endowment for
            the upkeep of his bridge at Torgau, and he had once commissioned
            Tetzel to preach its virtues; the other was to benefit pilgrims
            who visited and venerated his collection of relics on All Saints'
            Day. But it is clear that he disliked Indulgences of the kind
            Luther had challenged, and had small belief in the good faith of
            the Roman Curia. He had prevented money collected for one plenary
            Indulgence leaving the country, and he had forbidden Tetzel to
            preach the last Indulgence within his territories. His sympathies
            were all with Luther on this question. He was an esteemed patron
            of the pious society called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">St. Ursula's Schifflein</span></span>. He
            went to Mass regularly, and his attendances became frequent when
            he was in a state of hesitation or perplexity. When he was at
            Köln (November 1520), besieged by the papal nuncios to induce him
            to permit the publication of the Bull against Luther within his
            lands, Spalatin noted that he went to Mass three times in one
            day. His reverence for the Holy Scriptures must have created a
            bond of sympathy between Luther and himself. He talked with his
            private secretary about the incomparable majesty and power of the
            word of God, and contrasted its sublimities with the sophistries
            and trivialities of the theology of the day. He maintained firmly
            the traditional policy of his House to make the decisions of the
            Councils of Constance and of Basel effective within Electoral
            Saxony, in spite of protests from the Curia and the higher
            ecclesiastics, and was accustomed to consider himself responsible
            for the ecclesiastical as well as for the civil good government
            of his lands. Aleander had considered it a master-stroke of
            policy to procure the burning of Luther's books at Köln while the
            Elector was in the city. Frederick only regarded the deed as a
            petty insult to himself. He was a staunch upholder of the rights
            and liberties of the German nation, and remembered <span class=

            "Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that by an old concordat,
            which every Emperor had sworn to maintain, every German had the
            right to appeal to a General Council, and could not be condemned
            without a fair trial; and this Bull had made Luther's appeal to a
            Council one of the reasons for his condemnation. So, in spite of
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“golden rose”</span> and other
            blandishments, in spite of threats that he might be included in
            the excommunication of his subject and that the privileges of his
            University might be taken away, he stood firm, and would not
            withdraw his protection from Luther. He was a pious German prince
            of the old-fashioned type, with no great love for Italians, and
            was not going to be browbeaten by papal nuncios. His attitude
            towards Luther represents very fairly that of the great mass of
            the German people on the eve of the Diet of Worms.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rome had done
            its utmost to get rid of Luther by ecclesiastical measures, and
            had failed. If he was to be overthrown, if the new religious
            movement and the national uprising which enclosed it were to be
            stifled, this could only be done by the aid of the supreme
            secular authority. The Curia turned to the Emperor.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Maximilian had
            died suddenly on the 12th of January 1519. After some mouths of
            intriguing, the papal diplomacy <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            the young King of Spain, was unanimously chosen to be his
            successor (June 28th, 1519). Troubles in Spain prevented him
            leaving that country at once to take possession of his new
            dignities. He was crowned at Aachen on the 23rd of October 1520,
            and opened his first German Diet on January 22nd, 1521, at
            Worms.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Pope had
            selected two envoys to wait on the young Emperor, the Protonotary
            Marino Caraccioli (1469-1530), who was charged with the ordinary
            diplomatic business, and Jerome Aleander, the Director of the
            Vatican Library, who was appointed to secure the outlawry of
            Luther.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Roman
            Curia had in Aleander one of the most clear-sighted, courageous,
            and indefatigable of diplomatists. He was an Italian, born of a
            burgher family in the little Venetian town of Motta (1480-1542),
            educated at Padua and Venice; he had begun life as a Humanist,
            had lectured on Greek with distinction in Paris, and had been
            personally acquainted with many of the German Humanists, who
            could not forgive the <span class="tei tei-q">“traitor”</span>
            who had deserted their ranks to serve an obscurantist party. His
            graphic letters, full of minute details, throb with the hopes and
            fears of the papal diplomacy. The reader has his fingers on the
            pulse of those momentous mouths. The Legate was in a land where
            <span class="tei tei-q">“every stone and every tree cried out,
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘Luther.’</span> ”</span> Landlords
            refused him lodging. He had to shiver during these winter months
            in an attic without a stove. The stench and dirt of the house
            were worse than the cold. When he appeared on the streets he saw
            scowling faces, hands suddenly carried to the hilts of swords,
            heard curses shrieked after him. He was struck on the breast by a
            Lutheran doorkeeper when he tried to get audience of the Elector
            of Saxony, and no one in the crowd interfered to protect him. He
            saw caricatures of himself hanging head downwards from a gibbet.
            He received the old deadly German feud-letters from Ulrich von
            Hutten, safe in the neighbouring castle of Ebernberg, about a
            day's ride <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg
            263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a> The
            imperial Councillors to whom he complained had neither the men
            nor the means to protect him. When he tried to publish answers to
            the attacks on the Papacy which the Lutheran presses poured
            forth, he could scarcely find a printer; and when he did,
            syndicates bought up his pamphlets and destroyed them. As the
            weeks passed he came to understand that there was only one man on
            whom he could rely—the young Emperor, believed by all but himself
            to be a puppet in the hands of his Councillors, whom Pope Leo had
            called a <span class="tei tei-q">“good child,”</span> but whom
            Aleander from his first interview at Antwerp had felt to be
            endowed with <span class="tei tei-q">“a prudence far beyond his
            years,”</span> and to <span class="tei tei-q">“have much more at
            the back of his head than he carried on his face.”</span> He also
            came to believe that the one man to be feared was the old Elector
            of Saxony, <span class="tei tei-q">“that basilisk,”</span> that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“German fox,”</span> that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“marmot with the eyes of a dog, who glanced obliquely
            at his questioners.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Aleander was a
            pure worldling, a man of indifferent morals, showing traces of
            cold-blooded cruelty (as when he slew five peasants for the loss
            of one of his dogs, or tried to get Erasmus poisoned). He
            believed that every man had his price, and that low and selfish
            motives were alone to be reckoned with. But he did the work of
            the Curia at Worms with a thoroughness which merited the rewards
            he obtained afterwards.<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178"
            href="#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> He
            had spies everywhere—in the households of the Emperor and of the
            leading princes, and among the population of Worms. He had no
            hesitation in lying when he thought it useful for the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“faith,”</span> as he frankly
            relates.<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href=
            "#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a> The
            Curia had laid a difficult task upon him. He was to see that
            Luther was put under the ban of the Empire at once and unheard.
            The Bull had condemned him: the secular power had nothing to do
            but execute the sentence. Aleander had little difficulty in
            persuading the Emperor to this course within his hereditary
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name=
            "Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dominions. An
            edict was issued ordering Luther's books to be burnt, and the
            Legate had the satisfaction of presiding at several literary
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">auto-da-fés</span></span> in Antwerp and
            elsewhere. He was also successful with some of the ecclesiastical
            princes of Germany.<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a> But
            it was impossible to get this done at Worms. Failing this, it was
            Aleander's business to see that Luther's case was kept separate
            from the question of German national grievances against the
            Papacy, and that, if it proved to be impossible to prevent Luther
            appearing before the Diet, he was to be summoned there simply for
            the purpose of making public recantation. With the assistance of
            the Emperor he was largely successful.<a id="noteref_181" name=

            crisis had not come suddenly on him. As early as May 12th, 1520,
            Juan Manuel, his ambassador at Rome, had written to him asking
            him to pay some attention to <span class="tei tei-q">“a certain
            Martin Luther, who belongs to the following of the Elector of
            Saxony,”</span> and whose preaching was causing some discontent
            at the Roman Curia. Manuel thought that Luther might prove useful
            in a diplomatic dispute with the Curia.<a id="noteref_184" name=

            Charles had had time to think over the matter in his serious,
            reserved way; and this was the decision he had come to. The
            declaration was all the more memorable when it is remembered that
            Charles owed his election to that rising feeling of nationality
            which supported Luther,<a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185"
            href="#note_185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a> and
            that he had to make sure of German assistance in his coming
            struggle with Francis <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">i</span></span>. A certain grim
            reality lurked in the words, that he was ready to stake his
            dominions on the cause he adopted. There is much to be said for
            the opinion that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lutheran question
            made a man of the boy-ruler.”</span><a id="noteref_186" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
            hand, it is well to remember that the young Emperor did not take
            the side of the Pope nor commit himself to the Curial ideas of
            the absolute character of papal supremacy. He laid stress on the
            unity of the Catholic (mediæval) Church, on the continuity of its
            rites, and on the need of maintaining its authority; but the seat
            of that authority was for him a General Council. The declaration
            in no way conflicts with the changes in imperial <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id=

            during the opening weeks of the Diet, nor with that future action
            which led to the Sack of Rome and to the Augsburg Interim (1548).
            It is possible that the young ruler had read and admired Luther's
            earlier writings, and that he had counted on him as an aid in
            bringing the Church to a better condition. It is more than
            probable that he already believed that it was his duty to free
            the Church from the abuses which abounded;<a id="noteref_187"
            name="noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a> but
            Luther's fierce attack on the Pope disgusted him, and a
            reformation which came from the people threatened secular as well
            as ecclesiastical authority. He had made up his mind that Luther
            must be condemned, and told the German princes that he would not
            change one iota of his determination. But this did not prevent
            him making use of Luther to further his diplomatic dealings with
            the Pope and wring concessions from the Curia. For one thing, the
            Pope had been interfering with the Inquisition in Spain,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name=
            "Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> trying to mitigate
            its severity; and Charles, like his maternal grandfather,
            Ferdinand of Aragon, believed that the Holy Office was a help in
            curbing the freedom-loving people of Spain, and had no wish to
            see his instrument of punishment made less effectual. For
            another, it was evident that Francis <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">i.</span></span> was about to invade
            Italy, and Charles wished the Pope to take his side. If the Pope
            gave way to him on both of these points, he was ready to carry
            out his wishes about Luther as far as that was possible.<a id=

            (Charles was barely one and twenty), from whom men of all parties
            expected so much, had attracted much larger numbers than usually
            attended these assemblies. Weighty matters affecting all Germany
            were down on the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">agenda</span></span>. There was the old
            constitutional <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg
            268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            question of monarchy or oligarchy bequeathed from the Diets of
            Maximilian; curiosity to see whether the new ruler would place
            before the Estates a truly imperial policy, or whether, like his
            predecessors, he would subordinate national to dynastic
            considerations; the deputies from the cities were eager to get
            some sure provisions made for ending the private wars which
            disturbed trade; all classes were anxious to provide for an
            effective central government when the Emperor was absent from
            Germany; local statesmen felt the need of putting an end to the
            constant disputes between the ecclesiastical and secular powers
            within Germany; but the hardest problem of all, and the one which
            every man was thinking, talking, disputing about, was:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“To take notice of the books and
            descriptions made by Friar Martin Luther against the Court of
            Rome.”</span><a id="noteref_189" name="noteref_189" href=
            "#note_189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            Other exciting questions were stirring the crowds met at Worms
            besides those mentioned on the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">agenda</span></em> of the Diet. Men were
            talking about the need of making an end of the papal exactions
            which were draining Germany of money, and the air was full of
            rumours of what Sickingen and the knights might attempt, and
            whether there was going to be another peasant revolt. These
            questions were instinctively felt to hang together, and each had
            an importance because of the way in which it was connected with
            the religious and social problems of the day. For the people of
            Germany and for the foreign representatives who were gathered
            together at Worms, it is unquestionable that the Lutheran
            movement, and how it was to be dealt with, was the supreme
            problem of the moment. All these various things combined to bring
            together at Worms a larger concourse of people than had been
            collected in any German town since the meeting of the General
            Council at Constance in 1414.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Worms was one
            of the oldest towns in Germany. Its people were turbulent,
            asserting their rights as the inhabitants of a free imperial
            city, and in constant feud with <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> their bishop. They had endured many an
            interdict, were fiercely anti-clerical, and were to a man on
            Luther's side. The crowded streets were thronged with princes,
            their councillors and their retinues; with high ecclesiastical
            dignitaries and their attendant clergy; with nobles and their
            <span class="tei tei-q">“riders”</span>; with landsknechts,
            artisans, and peasants. Spanish, French, and Italian merchants,
            on their way home-wards from the Frankfurt fair, could be seen
            discussing the last phase of the Lutheran question, and Spanish
            nobles and Spanish merchants more than once came to blows in the
            narrow thoroughfares. The foreign merchants, especially the
            Spaniards, all appeared to take the Lutheran side; not because
            they took much interest in doctrines, but because they felt bound
            to stand up for the man who had dared to say that no one should
            be burned for his opinions. These Spanish merchants made
            themselves very prominent. They joined in syndicates with the
            more fervent German partisans of Luther to buy up and destroy
            papal pamphlets; they bought Luther's writings to carry home.
            Aleander curses these <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">marrani</span></span>,<a id="noteref_190"
            name="noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class=

            he calls them, and relates that they are getting Luther's works
            translated into Spanish. It is probable that many of them had
            Moorish blood in them, and knew the horrors of the Inquisition.
            Aleander's spies told him that caricatures of himself and other
            prominent papalists were hawked about, and that pictures of
            Luther with the Dove hovering over his head, Luther with his head
            crowned with a halo of rays, Luther and Hutten,<a id=

            one with a Bible and the other with a sword, were eagerly bought
            in the streets. These pictures were actually sold in the courts
            and rooms of the episcopal palace where the Emperor was lodged.
            On the steps of the churches, at the doors of public buildings,
            colporteurs offered to eager <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            Pope, and the satires of Ulrich von Hutten in Latin and in
            German. On the streets and in open spaces like the Market, crowds
            of keen disputants argued about the teaching of Luther, and
            praised him in the most exaggerated ways.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Inside the
            Electoral College opinion was divided. The Archbishop of Köln,
            the Elector of Brandenburg, and his brother the Archbishop of
            Mainz, were for Luther's condemnation, while the Elector of
            Saxony had great influence over the Archbishop of Trier and the
            Count Palatine of the Rhine. The latter, says Aleander, scarcely
            opened his mouth during the year, but now <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“roared like ten bulls”</span> on Luther's behalf.
            Aleander had his first opportunity of addressing the Diet on
            February 13th. He spoke for three hours, and made a strong
            impression. He dwelt on Luther's doctrinal errors, which he said
            were those of the Waldenses, of Wiclif, and of the Hussites. He
            said that Luther denied the Presence of Christ in the Holy
            Supper, and that he was a second Arius.<a id="noteref_192" name=

            During the days that followed the members of the Diet came to a
            common understanding. They presented a memorial in German
            (February 19th) to the Emperor, in which they reminded him that
            no imperial edict could be published against Luther without their
            consent, and that to do so before Luther had a hearing would lead
            to bloodshed; they proposed that Luther should be invited to come
            to Worms under a safe conduct, and in the presence of the Diet be
            asked whether he was the author of the books that were attributed
            to him, and whether he could clear himself of the accusation of
            denying fundamental articles of the faith; that he should also be
            heard upon the papal claims, and the Diet would judge upon them;
            and, finally, they prayed the Emperor to deliver Germany from the
            papal tyranny.<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href=

            Emperor agreed that Luther should be summoned under a safe
            conduct and interrogated about his books, and whether he had
            denied any fundamental doctrines. But he utterly refused to
            permit any discussion on the authority of the <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id=
            "Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Pope, and declared that he
            would himself communicate with His Holiness about the complaints
            of Germany.<a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The documents
            in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichstagsakten</span></span> reveal not
            only that there was a decided difference of opinion between the
            Emperor and the majority of the Estates about the way in which
            Luther ought to be treated, but that the policy of the Emperor
            and his advisers had changed between November 1520 and February
            1521. Aleander had found no difficulty in persuading Charles and
            his Flemish councillors that, so far as the Emperor's hereditary
            dominions were concerned, the only thing that the civil power had
            to do was to issue an edict homologating the Papal Bull banning
            Luther and his adherents, and ordering his books to be burnt.
            This had been done in the Netherlands. They had made
            difficulties, however, about such summary action within the
            German Empire. Aleander was told that the Emperor could do
            nothing until after the coronation at Aachen (October
            1520);<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href=
            "#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> and
            in November, much to the nuncio's disgust, the Emperor had
            written to the Elector of Saxony (November 28th, 1520) from
            Oppenheim asking him to bring Luther with him to the Diet.<a id=
            "noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a> At
            that time Luther had no great wish to go to the Diet, unless it
            was clearly understood that he was summoned not for the purpose
            of merely making a recantation, but in order that he might defend
            his views with full liberty of speech. He was not going to
            recant, and he could say so as easily and clearly at Wittenberg
            as at Worms. The situation had changed at Worms. The Emperor had
            come over to the nuncio's side completely. He now saw no need for
            Luther's appearance. The Diet had nothing to do but to place
            Luther under the ban of the Empire, because he had been declared
            to be a heretic by the Roman Pontiff. Aleander claimed all the
            credit for this change; but it is more than <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id=
            "Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> probable that the explanation
            lies in the shifting imperial and papal policy. In the end of
            1520 the policy of the Roman Curia was strongly anti-imperialist.
            The Emperor's ambassador at Rome, Don Manuel, had been warning
            his master of the papal intrigues against him, and suggesting
            that Charles might show some favour to a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“certain Martin Luther”</span>; and this advice might
            easily have inspired the letter of the 28th of November. At all
            events the papal policy had been changing, and showing signs of
            becoming less hostile to the Emperor. However the matter be
            accounted for, Aleander found that after the Emperor's presence
            within Worms it was much more easy for him to press the papal
            view about Luther upon Charles and his advisers.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
            hand, the Germans in the Diet held stoutly to the opinion that no
            countryman of theirs should be placed under the ban of the Empire
            without being heard in his defence, and that they and not the
            Bishop of Rome were to be the judges in the matter.</p>

            Luther calmly finished some literary work, and left for the Diet
            on April 2nd. He believed that he was going to his death.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“My dear brother,”</span> he said to
            Melanchthon at parting, <span class="tei tei-q">“if I do not come
            back, if my enemies put me to death, you will go on teaching and
            standing fast in the truth; if you live, my death will matter
            little.”</span> The journey seemed to the indignant Papists like
            a royal progress; crowds came to bless the man who had stood up
            for Germany against the Pope, and who was going to his death for
            his courage; they pressed into the inns where he rested, and
            often found him solacing himself with music. His lute was always
            comforting to him in times of excitement. Justus Jonas, the
            famous German Humanist, who had turned theologian much to
            Erasmus' disgust, joined him at Erfurt. The nearer he came to
            Worms, the sharper became the disputes there. Friends and foes
            feared that his presence would prove oil thrown on the flames.
            The Emperor began to wish he had not sent the summons. Messengers
            were despatched secretly to Sickingen, and a pension promised to
            Hutten to see whether they could not prevent Luther's
            appearance.<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href=

            Might he not take refuge in the Ebernberg, scarcely a day's
            journey from Worms? Was it not possible to arrange matters in a
            private conference with Glapion, the Emperor's confessor? Bucer
            was sent to persuade him. The herald significantly called his
            attention to the imperial edict ordering magistrates to seize his
            writings. But nothing daunted Luther. He would not go to the
            Ebernberg; he could see Glapion at Worms, if the confessor wished
            an interview; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg

            what he had to say would be said publicly at Worms.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther had
            reached Oppenheim, a town on the Rhine about fifteen miles north
            from Worms, and about twenty east from the Ebernberg, on April
            14th. There he for the last time rejected the insidious
            temptations of his enemies and the distracted counsels of his
            friends, that he should turn aside and seek shelter with Francis
            von Sickingen. There he penned his famous letter to Spalatin,
            that he would come to Worms if there were as many devils as tiles
            on the house roofs to prevent him, and at the same time asked
            where he was to lodge.<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204"

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question
            was important. The Romanists had wished that Luther should be
            placed under the Emperor's charge as a prisoner of State, or else
            lodged in the Convent of the Augustinian Eremites, where he could
            be under ecclesiastical surveillance. But the Saxon nobles and
            their Elector had resolved to trust no one with the custody of
            their countryman. The Elector Frederick and part of his suite had
            found accommodation at an inn called <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
            Swan</span></span>, and the rest of his following were in the
            House of the Knights of St. John. Both houses were full; but it
            was arranged that Luther was to share the room of two Saxon
            gentlemen, v. Hirschfeld and v. Schott, in the latter
            building.<a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href=

            Next morning, Justus Jonas, who had reached Worms before Luther,
            after consultation with Luther's friends, left the town early on
            Tuesday morning (April 16th) to meet the Reformer, and tell him
            the arrangements made. With him went the two gentlemen with whom
            Luther was to lodge.<a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href=

            large number of Saxon noblemen with their attendants accompanied
            them. When it was known that they had set out to meet Luther, a
            great crowd of people (nearly two thousand, says Secretary
            Vogler), some on horseback and some on foot, followed to welcome
            Luther, and did meet him about two and a half miles from the
            town.<a id="noteref_207" name="noteref_207" href=

            before eleven o'clock the watcher on tower by the Mainz Gate blew
            his horn to announce that the procession was in sight, and soon
            afterwards Luther entered the town. The people of Worms were at

            Caspar Sturm, the herald, rode first, accompanied by his
            attendant, the square yellow banner, emblazoned with the black
            two-headed eagle, attached to his bridle arm. Then came the

            companions sitting in the straw which half filled it. The waggon
            had been provided by the good town of Wittenberg, which had also

            colleague Nicholas Amsdorf; and a student of Wittenberg, a young
            Pomeranian noble, Peter Swaven, who had been one of the
            Wittenberg students who had accompanied Luther with halbert and
            helmet to the Leipzig Disputation (July 1519). Justus Jonas rode
            immediately behind the waggon, and then followed the crowd of
            nobles and people who had gone out to meet the Reformer.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Aleander in
            his attic room heard the shouts and the trampling in the streets,
            and sent out one of his people to find out the cause, guessing
            that it was occasioned by Luther's arrival. The messenger
            reported that the procession had made its way through dense
            crowds of people, and that the waggon had stopped at the door of
            the House of the Knights of St. John. He also informed the nuncio
            that Luther had got out, saying, as he looked round with his

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After
            travel-stains were removed, Luther dined with ten or twelve
            friends. The early afternoon brought crowds of visitors, some of
            whom had come great distances to see him. Then came long
            discussions about how he was to act on the morrow before the
            Diet. The Saxon councillors v. Feilitzsch and v. Thun were in the
            same house with him: the Saxon Chancellor, v. Brück, and Luther's
            friend Spalatin, were at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">The Swan</span></span>, a few doors away.
            Jerome Schurf, the Professor of Law in Wittenberg, had been
            summoned to Worms by the Elector to act as Luther's legal
            adviser, and had reached the town some days before the
            Reformer.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How much
            Luther knew of the secret intrigues that had been going on at
            Worms about his affairs it is impossible to say. He probably was
            aware that the Estates had demanded that he should have a
            hearing, and should be confronted by impartial theologians, and
            that the complaints of the German nation against Rome should be
            taken up at the same time; also that the Emperor had refused to
            allow any theological discussion, or that the grievances against
            Rome should be part of the proceedings. All that was public
            property. The imperial summons and safe conduct had not treated
            him as a condemned heretic.<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212"
            href="#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a> He
            had been addressed in it as <span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Ehrsamer</span></span>, <span lang="de"

            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">andächtiger</span></span>—terms which would
            not have been used to a heretic, and which were ostentatiously
            omitted from the safe conduct sent him by Duke George of
            Saxony.<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href=
            "#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a> He
            knew also that the Emperor had nevertheless published an edict
            ordering the civil authorities to seize his <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id=
            "Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> books, and to prevent more
            from being printed, published, or sold, and that such an edict
            threw doubts upon the value of the safe conduct.<a id=
            "noteref_214" name="noteref_214" href="#note_214"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a> But
            he probably did not know that this edict was a third draft issued
            by the Emperor without consulting the Diet. Nor is it likely that
            he knew how Aleander had been working day and night to prevent
            his appearance at the Diet from being more than a mere formality,
            nor how far the nuncio had prevailed with the Emperor and with
            his councillors. His friends could tell him all this—though even
            they were not aware until next morning how resolved the Emperor
            was that Luther should not be permitted to make a speech.<a id=
            "noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a>
            They knew enough, however, to be able to impress on Luther that
            he must restrain himself, and act in such a way as to force the
            hands of his opponents, and gain permission to speak at length in
            a second audience. The Estates wished to hear him if the Emperor
            and his entourage had resolved to prevent him from speaking.
            These consultations probably settled the tactics which Luther
            followed on his first appearance before the Diet.<a id=
            "noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href="#note_216"><span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next morning
            (Wednesday, April 17th), Ulrich von Pappenheim, the marshal of
            ceremonies, came to Luther's room before ten o'clock, and,
            greeting him courteously and with all respect, informed him that
            he was to appear before the Emperor and the Diet that day at four
            o'clock, when he would be informed why he had been
            summoned.<a id="noteref_217" name="noteref_217" href=
            "#note_217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a>
            Immediately after the marshal had left, there came an urgent
            summons from a Saxon noble, Hans von Minkwitz, who was dying in
            his lodgings, that Luther would come to hear his confession and
            administer the sacrament to him. Luther instantly went to soothe
            and comfort the dying man, notwithstanding his own
            troubles.<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href=
            "#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            information how the hours between twelve and four were spent. It
            is almost certain that there must have been another consultation.
            Spalatin and Brück had discovered that the conduct of the
            audience was not to be in the hands of Glapion, the confessor of
            the Emperor, as they had up to that time supposed, but in those
            of John Eck, the Orator or Official of the Archbishop of
            Trier.<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href=
            "#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a>
            This looked badly for Luther. Eck had been officiously busy in
            burning Luther's books at Trier; he lodged in the same house and
            in the room next to the papal nuncio.<a id="noteref_220" name=

            Aleander, indeed, boasts that Eck was entirely devoted to him,
            and that he had been able to draft the question which Eck put to
            Luther during the first audience.<a id="noteref_221" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A little
            before four o'clock, the marshal and Caspar Sturm, the herald,
            came to Luther's lodging to escort him to the audience hall. They
            led the Reformer into the street to conduct him to the Bishop's
            Palace, where the Emperor was living along with his younger
            brother Ferdinand, afterwards King of the Romans and Emperor, and
            where the Diet met.<a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href=

            streets were thronged; faces looked down from every window; men
            and women had crowded the roofs to catch a glimpse of Luther as
            he passed. It was difficult to force a way through the crowd,
            and, besides, Sturm, who was responsible for Luther's safety,
            feared that some Spaniard might deal the <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class=

            So the three turned into the court of the Swan Hotel; from it
            they got into the garden of the House of the Knights of St. John;
            and, as most of the courts and gardens of the houses communicated
            with each other, they were able to get into the court of the
            Bishop's Palace without again appearing on the street.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The court of
            the Palace was full of people eager to see Luther, most of them
            evidently friendly. It was here that old General Frundsberg, the
            most illustrious soldier in Germany, who was to be the conqueror
            in the famous fight at Pavia, clapped Luther kindly on the
            shoulder, and said words which have been variously reported.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“My poor monk! my little monk! thou art
            on thy way to make a stand as I and many of my knights have never
            done in our toughest battles. If thou art sure of the justice of
            thy cause, then forward in the name of God, and be of good
            courage: God will not forsake thee.”</span> From out the crowd,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“here and there and from every corner,
            came voices saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Play the man! Fear
            not death; it can but slay the body: there is a life

            They went up the stair and entered the audience hall, which was
            crammed. While the marshal and the herald forced a way for
            Luther, he passed an old acquaintance, the deputy from Augsburg.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, Doctor Peutinger,”</span> said
            Luther, <span class="tei tei-q">“are you here too?”</span><a id=

            Then he was led to where he was to stand before the Emperor; and
            these two lifelong opponents saw each other for the first time.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The fool entered smiling,”</span> says
            Aleander (perhaps the lingering of the smile with which he had
            just greeted Dr. Peutinger): <span class="tei tei-q">“he looked
            slowly round, and his face sobered.”</span> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“When he faced the Emperor,”</span> Aleander goes on
            to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“he could not hold his head

            eyes were fixed on Luther, and many an account was written
            describing his appearance. <span class="tei tei-q">“A man of
            middle height,”</span> says an unsigned Spanish paper preserved
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name=

            He was clad in the robe of the Augustinian Order, but with a belt
            of hide, with a large tonsure, newly shaven, and a coronal of

            noticed his gleaming eyes; and it was remarked that when his
            glance fell on an Italian, the man moved uneasily in his seat, as
            if <span class="tei tei-q">“the evil eye was upon him.”</span>
            Meanwhile, in the seconds before the silence was broken, Luther
            was making <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">his</span></em> observations. He noticed the
            swarthy Jewish-looking face of Aleander, with its gleam of
            hateful triumph. <span class="tei tei-q">“So the Jews must have
            looked at Christ,”</span> he thought.<a id="noteref_229" name=

            saw the young Emperor, and near him the papal nuncios and the
            great ecclesiastics of the Empire. A wave of pity passed through
            him as he looked. <span class="tei tei-q">“He seemed to
            me,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“like some poor lamb

            There was a table or bench with some books upon it. When Luther's
            glance fell on them, he saw that they were his own writings, and
            could not help wondering how they had got there.<a id=

            did not know that Aleander had been collecting them for some
            weeks, and that, at command of the Emperor, he had handed them
            over to John Eck, the Official of Trier, for the purposes of the
            audience.<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href=

            Jerome Schurf made his way to Luther's side, and stood ready to
            assist in legal difficulties.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The past and

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther made
            his answer in a low voice—so low that the deputies from
            Strassburg, who were sitting not far from him, said that they
            could not hear him distinctly.<a id="noteref_241" name=

            Many present inferred from the low voice that Luther's spirit was
            broken, and that he was beginning to be afraid. But from what
            followed it is evident that Luther's whole procedure on this
            first appearance before the Diet was intended to defeat the
            intrigues of Aleander, which had for <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> their aim to prevent the Reformer
            addressing the Diet in a long speech; and in this he succeeded,
            as Brück and Spalatin hoped he would.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Estates
            then proceeded to deliberate on Luther's request. Aleander says
            that the Emperor called his councillors about him; that the
            Electors talked with each other; and that the separate Estates
            deliberated separately.<a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242"

            are informed by the report of the Venetian ambassadors that there
            was some difficulty among some of them in acceding to Luther's

            Luther:</p>

            Luther was besieged by visitors. Familiar friends came to see him

            Bucer rode over from the Ebernberg in the afternoon with
            congratulations on the way that the first audience had been got
            through, and bringing letters from Ulrich von Hutten. His friends

            George Vogler and others had <span class="tei tei-q">“much pious

            and the herald came for Luther a little after four o'clock, and

            The crowds on the streets were even larger than on the day
            before. It was said that more than five thousand people, Germans
            and foreigners, were crushed together in the street before the
            Palace. The throng was so dense that some of the delegates, like

            entered the hall. Luther and the herald had been kept waiting in
            the court of the Palace for more than an hour and a half, bruised
            by the dense moving crowd. In the hall the throng was so great
            that the princes had some difficulty in getting to their seats,
            and found themselves uncomfortably crowded when they reached
            them.<a id="noteref_249" name="noteref_249" href=

            notable men were absent. The papal nuncios refused to be present
            when a heretic was permitted to speak. Such proceedings were the
            merest tomfoolery (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">ribaldaria</span></span>), Aleander said.
            When Luther reached the door, he had still to wait; the princes
            were occupied in reaching their places, and it was not etiquette
            for him to appear until they were seated.<a id="noteref_250"

            day was darkening, and the gloomy hall flamed with torches.<a id=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">251</span></span></a>
            Observers remarked Luther's wonderful cheerful countenance as he
            made his way to his place.<a id="noteref_252" name="noteref_252"
            href="#note_252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Emperor
            had intrusted the procedure to Aleander, to his confessor
            Glapion, and to John Eck, who had conducted the audience on the
            previous day.<a id="noteref_253" name="noteref_253" href=
            "#note_253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">253</span></span></a> The
            Official was again to have the conduct of matters in his hands.
            As soon as Luther was in his place, Eck <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“rushed into words”</span> (<span lang="la" class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a> He
            began by recapitulating what had taken place at the first
            audience; and in saying that Luther had asked time for
            consideration, he insinuated that every Christian ought to be
            ready at all times to give a reason for the faith that is in him,
            much more a learned theologian like Luther. He declared that it
            was now time for Luther to answer plainly whether he adhered to
            the contents of the books he had acknowledged to be his, or
            whether he was prepared to recant them. He spoke first in Latin
            and then in German, and it was noticed that his speech in Latin
            was very bitter.<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href=
            "#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Luther
            delivered his famous speech before the Diet. He had freed himself
            from the web of intrigue that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Aleander had been at such pains to weave
            round him to compel him to silence, and stood forth a free German
            to plead his cause before the most illustrious audience the
            Fatherland could offer to any of its sons.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before him was
            the Emperor and his brother Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria,
            destined to be King of the Romans and Emperor in days to come,
            and beside them, seated, all the Electors and the great Princes
            of the Empire, lay and ecclesiastical, among them four Cardinals.
            All round him standing, for there was no space for seats, the
            Counts, Free Nobles and Knights of the Empire, and the delegates
            of the great cities, were closely packed together.<a id=

            Ambassadors and the political agents of almost all the countries
            in Europe were there to swell the crowd—ready to report the issue
            of this momentous day. For all believed that whatever weighty
            business for Germany was discussed at this Diet, the question
            raised by Luther was one of European importance, and affected the
            countries which they represented. The rumour had gone about,
            founded mainly on the serene appearance of Luther, that the monk
            was about to recant;<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href=
            "#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a> and
            most of the political agents earnestly hoped it might be true.
            That and that only would end, they believed, the symptoms of
            disquiet which the governments of every land were anxiously
            watching.</p>

            several papers, all of which profess to give Luther's speech; but
            they are mere summaries, some longer and some shorter, and give
            no indication of the power which thrilled the audience. Its
            effect must be sought for in the descriptions of the hearers.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The specimens
            of his books which had been collected by Aleander were so
            representative that Luther could speak of all his writings. He
            divided them into three classes. He had written books for
            edification which he could truly say had been approved by all
            men, friends and foes alike, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> and it was scarcely to be expected that he,
            the author, should be the only man to recant the contents of such
            writings as even the Papal Bull had commended. In a second class
            of writings he had attacked the papal tyranny which all Germany
            was groaning under; to recant the contents of these books would
            be to make stronger and less endurable the monstrous evil he had
            protested against; he therefore refused to recall such writings;
            no loyal German could do so. He had also written against
            individual persons who had supported the Papacy; it was possible
            that he had written too strongly in some places and against some
            men; he was only a man and not God, and was liable to make
            mistakes; he remembered how Christ, who could not err, had acted
            when He was accused, and imitating Him, he was quite ready, if
            shown to be wrong, by evangelical or prophetic witnesses, to
            renounce his errors, and if he were convinced, he assured the
            Emperor and princes assembled that he would be the first to throw
            his books into the fire. He dwelt upon the power of the word of
            God which must prevail over everything, and showed that many
            calamities in times past had fallen upon nations who had
            neglected its teachings and warnings. He concluded as
            follows:</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther had
            spoken in Latin; he was asked to repeat what he had said in
            German. The Hall had been packed; the torches gave forth warmth
            as well as light. Luther steamed with perspiration, and looked
            wan and overpowered; the heat was intense. Friends thought that
            the further effort would be too much for his strength. The Saxon
            councillor, Frederick von Thun, regardless of etiquette, called
            out loudly, <span class="tei tei-q">“If you cannot do it you have
            done <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg

            Luther went on and finished his address in German. His last words
            were. <span class="tei tei-q">“Here I stand (<span lang="de"

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Aleander, the
            papal nuncio, who was not present, relates that while Luther was
            speaking of the books in which he had attacked the Papacy, and
            was proceeding <span class="tei tei-q">“with great venom”</span>
            to denounce the Pope,<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a> the
            Emperor ordered him to pass from that subject and to proceed with
            his other matters. The Emperor had certainly told the Estates
            that he would not allow the question of Luther's orthodoxy and
            complaints against the Holy See to be discussed together; and
            that lends some support to Aleander's statement.<a id=

            when it is seen that not one of the dozen deputies present who
            write accounts of the scene mentions the interruption; when it is
            not found in the official report; when it is remembered that
            Charles could not understand either German or Latin, the story of
            the interruption is a very unlikely one. Aleander was not
            remarkable for his veracity—<span class="tei tei-q">“a man, to
            say the least, not bigotedly truthful (<span lang="la" class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Several
            letters descriptive of the scene, written by men who were present
            in the Diet, reveal the intense interest taken by the great
            majority of the audience in the appearance and speech of Luther.
            His looks, his language, the attitude in which he stood, are all
            described. When artists portray the scene, either on canvas or in
            bronze, Luther is invariably represented standing upright, his
            shoulders squared, and his head thrown back. That was not how he
            stood before Charles and the Diet. He was a monk, <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id=
            "Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> trained in the conventional
            habits of monkish humility. He stood with a stoop of the head and
            shoulders, with the knees slightly bent, and without gestures.
            The only trace of bodily emotion was betrayed by bending and
            straightening his knees.<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264"

            addressed the Emperor and the Estates with all
            respect,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Most serene Lord and Emperor,
            most illustrious Princes, most clement Lords,”</span>—and
            apologised for any lack of etiquette on the ground that he was
            convent-bred and knew nothing of the ways of Courts; but it was
            noticed by more than one observer that he did not address the
            spiritual princes present.<a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265"

            Many a witness describes the charm of his cheerful, modest, but
            undaunted bearing.<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href=

            Saxon official account says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Luther
            spoke simply, quietly, modestly, yet not without Christian
            courage and fidelity—in such a way, too, that his enemies would
            have doubtless preferred a more abject spirit and speech”</span>;
            and it goes on to relate that his adversaries had confidently
            counted on a recantation, and that they were correspondingly
            disappointed.<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href=

            Many expected that, as he had never before been in such presence,
            the strange audience would have disconcerted him; but, to their
            surprise and delight, he spoke <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“confidently, reasonably, and prudently, as if he
            were in his own lecture-room.”</span><a id="noteref_268" name=

            Luther himself was surprised that the unaccustomed surroundings
            affected him so little. <span class="tei tei-q">“When it came to
            my turn,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I just went
            on.”</span><a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href=

            beauty of his diction pleased his audience—<span class=

            and others.<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Luther
            had finished, the Official, mindful that it was his duty to
            extract from Luther a distinct recantation, addressed him in a
            threatening manner (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">increpabundo

            to the point. The question was that Luther, in some of his books,
            denied decisions of Councils: Would he reaffirm or recant what he
            had said about these decisions? the Emperor <span class=

            <span class="tei tei-q">“If His Imperial Majesty desires a plain

            Official addressed Luther at some length. He told him that in his
            speech he had abused the clemency of the Emperor, and had added
            to his evil deeds by attacking the Pope and Papists (<span lang=

            briefly recapitulated Luther's speech, and said that he had not
            sufficiently distinguished between his books and his opinions;
            there might be room for discussion had Luther brought forward
            anything new, but his errors were old—the errors of the Poor Men
            of Lyons, Wiclif, of John and Jerome Huss (the learned Official
            gave Huss a brother unknown to history),<a id="noteref_273" name=

            which were decided upon at the Council of Constance, where the
            whole German nation had been gathered together; he again asked
            him to retract such opinions. To this Luther replied as before,
            that General Councils had erred, and that his conscience did not
            allow him to retract. By this time the torches had burnt to their
            sockets, and the hall was growing dark.<a id="noteref_274" name=

            Wearied with the crowd and the heat, numbers were preparing to
            leave. The Official, making a last effort, called out loudly,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Martin, let your conscience alone;
            recant your errors and you will be safe and sound; you can never
            show that a Council has erred.”</span> Luther declared that
            Councils had erred, and that he could prove it.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is evident
            from almost all the reports that from the time that Luther had
            finished his great speech there was a good deal of confusion, and
            probably of conversation, among the audience. All that the
            greater portion of those present heard was an altercation between
            Luther and the Official, due, most of the Germans thought, to the
            overbearing conduct of Eck, and which the Italians and Spaniards
            attributed to the pertinacity of Luther.<a id="noteref_278" name=

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Luther asserted that Councils had erred
            several times, and had given decisions against the law of God.
            The Official said No; Luther said Yes, and that he could prove

            all understood that there was a good deal said about the Council
            of Constance.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Emperor
            left his throne to go to his private rooms; the Electors and the
            princes sought their hotels. A number of Spaniards, perceiving
            that Luther turned to leave the tribunal, broke out into
            hootings, and followed <span class="tei tei-q">“the man of God
            with prolonged howlings.”</span><a id="noteref_280" name=

            Then the Germans, nobles and delegates from the towns, ringed him

            him, and as they passed from the hall they all at once, and
            Luther in the midst of them, thrust forward arms and raised hands
            high above their heads, in the way that a German knight was
            accustomed to do when he had unhorsed his antagonist in the
            tourney, or that a German landsknecht did when he had struck a
            victorious blow. The Spaniards rushed to the door shouting after
            Luther, <span class="tei tei-q">“To the fire with him, to the
            fire!”</span><a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href=

            crowd on the street thought that Luther was being sent to prison,
            and thought of a rescue.<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282"
            href="#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            Luther calmed them by saying that the company were escorting him
            home. Thus, with hands held high in stern challenge to Holy Roman
            Empire and mediæval Church, they accompanied Luther to his
            lodging.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Friends had
            got there before him—Spalatin, ever faithful; Oelhafen, who had
            not been able to reach his place in the Diet because of the
            throng. Luther, with beaming face, stretched out both his hands,
            exclaiming, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am through, I am
            through!”</span><a id="noteref_283" name="noteref_283" href=

            a few minutes Spalatin was called away. He soon returned. The old
            Elector had summoned him only to say, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“How well, father, Dr. Luther spoke this day before
            the Emperor and the Estates; but he is too bold for me.”</span>
            The sturdy old German prince wrote to his brother John,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“From what I have heard this day, I will
            never believe that Luther is a heretic”</span>; and a few days
            later, <span class="tei tei-q">“At this Diet, not only Annas and
            Caiaphas, but also Pilate and Herod, have conspired against
            Luther.”</span> Frederick of Saxony was no Lutheran, like his
            brother John and his nephew John Frederick; and he was the better
            able to express what most German princes were thinking about
            Luther and his appearance before the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            momentary admiration; and Duke Eric of Brunswick, who had taken
            the papal side, could not sit down to supper without sending
            Luther a can of Einbecker beer from his own table.<a id=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a> As
            for the commonalty, there was a wild uproar in the streets of
            Worms that night—men cursing the Spaniards and Italians, and
            praising Luther, who had compelled the Emperor and the prelates
            to hear what he had to say, and who had voiced the complaints of
            the Fatherland against the Roman Curia at the risk of his life.
            The voice of the people found utterance in a placard, which next
            morning was seen posted up on the street corners of the town,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Woe to the land whose king is a
            child.”</span> It was the beginning of the disillusion of
            Germany. The people had believed that they were securing a German
            Emperor when, in a fit of enthusiasm, they had called upon the
            Electors to choose the grandson of Maximilian. They were
            beginning to find that they had selected a Spaniard.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next day
            (April 19th) the Emperor proposed that Luther should be placed
            under the ban of the Empire. The Estates were not satisfied, and
            insisted that something should be done to effect a compromise.
            Luther had not been treated as they had proposed in their
            memorandum of the 19th February. He had been peremptorily ordered
            to retract. The Emperor had permitted Aleander to regulate the
            order of procedure on the day previous (April 18th), and the
            result had not been satisfactory. Even the Elector of Brandenburg
            and his brother, the hesitating Archbishop of Mainz, did not wish
            matters to remain as they were. They knew the feelings of the
            German people, if they were ignorant of the Emperor's diplomatic
            dealings with the Pope. The Emperor gave way, but told them that
            he would let them hear his own view of the matter. He produced a
            sheet of paper, and read a short statement prepared by
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name=
            "Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> himself in the
            French tongue—the language with which Charles was most familiar.
            It was the memorable declaration of his own religious position,
            which has been referred to already.<a id="noteref_285" name=
            "noteref_285" href="#note_285"><span class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a>
            Aleander reports that several of the princes became pale as death
            when they heard it.<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href=
            "#note_286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a> In
            later discussions the Emperor asserted with warmth that he would
            never change one iota of his declaration.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
            the Diet appointed a Commission (April 22nd) to confer with
            Luther, and at its head was placed the Archbishop of Trier, who
            was perhaps the only one among the higher ecclesiastics of
            Germany whom Luther thoroughly trusted. They had several meetings
            with the Reformer, the first being on the 24th of April. All the
            members of the Commission were sincerely anxious to arrange a
            compromise; but after the Emperor's declaration that was
            impossible, as Luther himself clearly saw. No set of resolutions,
            however skilfully framed, could reconcile the Emperor's belief
            that a General Council was infallible and Luther's phrase,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“a conscience bound to the Holy
            Scriptures.”</span> No proposals to leave the final decision to
            the Emperor and the Pope, to the Emperor alone, to the Emperor
            and the Estates, to a future General Council (all of which were
            made), could patch up a compromise between two such contradictory
            standpoints. Compromise must fail in a fight of faiths, and that
            was the nature of the opposition between Charles <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">v.</span></span> and Luther throughout
            their lives. What divided them was no subordinate question about
            doctrine or ritual; it was fundamental, amounting to an entirely
            different conception of the whole round of religion. The moral
            authority of the individual conscience confronted the legal
            authority of an ecclesiastical assembly. In after days the monk
            regretted that he had not spoken out more boldly before the Diet.
            Shortly before his death, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> the Emperor expressed his regret that he
            had not burned the obstinate heretic. When the Commission had
            failed, Luther asked leave to reveal his whole innermost thoughts
            to the Archbishop of Trier, under the seal of confession, and the
            two had a memorable private interview. Aleander fiercely attacked
            the Archbishop for refusing to disclose what passed between them;
            but the prelate was a German bishop with a conscience, and not an
            unscrupulous dependant on a shameless Curia. No one knew what
            Luther's confession was. The Commission had to report that its
            efforts had proved useless. Luther was ordered to leave Worms and
            return to Wittenberg, without preaching on the journey; his safe
            conduct was to expire in twenty-one days after the 26th of April.
            At their expiry he was liable to be seized and put to death as a
            pestilent heretic. There remained only to draft and publish the
            edict containing the ban. The days passed, and it did not
            appear.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly the
            startling news reached Worms that Luther had disappeared, no one
            knew where. Aleander, as usual, had the most exact information,
            and gives the fullest account of the rumours which were flying
            about. Cochlæus, who was at Frankfurt, sent him a man who had
            been at Eisenach, had seen Luther's uncle, and had been told by
            him about the capture. Five horsemen had dashed at the travelling
            waggon, had seized Luther, and had ridden off with him. Who the
            captors were or by whose authority they had acted, no one could
            tell. <span class="tei tei-q">“Some blame me,”</span> says
            Aleander, <span class="tei tei-q">“others the Archbishop of
            Mainz: would God it were true!”</span> Some thought that
            Sickingen had carried him off to protect him; others, the Elector
            of Saxony; others, the Count of Mansfeld. One persistent rumour
            declared that a personal enemy of the Elector of Saxony, one Hans
            Beheim, had been the captor; and the Emperor rather believed it.
            On May 14th a letter reached Worms saying that Luther's body had
            been found in a silver-mine pierced with a dagger. The news flew
            over Germany and beyond it that Luther had been done to death by
            emissaries of the Roman Curia; and so persistent was the belief,
            that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg
            296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            Aleander prepared to justify the deed by alleging that the
            Reformer had broken the imperial safe conduct by preaching at
            Eisenach and by addressing a concourse of people at
            Frankfurt.<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href=

            Albert Dürer, in Ghent, noted down in his private diary that
            Luther, <span class="tei tei-q">“the God-inspired man,”</span>
            had been slain by the Pope and his priests as our Lord had been
            put to death by the priests in Jerusalem. <span class=

            Friends wrote distracted letters to Wittenberg imploring Luther
            to tell them whether he was alive or imprisoned.<a id=

            news created the greatest consternation and indignation in Worms.
            The Emperor's decision had been little liked even by the princes
            most incensed against Luther. Aleander could not get even the
            Archbishop of Mainz to promise that he would publish it. When the
            Commission of the Diet had failed to effect a compromise, the
            doors of the Rathhaus and of other public buildings in Worms had
            been placarded with an intimation that four hundred knights had
            sworn that they would not leave Luther unavenged, and the ominous
            words <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            appeared on it. The Emperor had treated the matter lightly; but
            the German Romanist princes had been greatly alarmed.<a id=

            They knew, if he did not, that the union of peasants with the
            lower nobility had been a possible source of danger to Germany
            for nearly a century; they remembered that it was this
            combination which had made the great Bohemian rising successful.
            Months after the Diet had risen, Romanist partisans in Germany
            sent anxious communications to the Pope about <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id=
            "Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the dangers of a combination
            of the lesser nobility with the peasants.<a id="noteref_291"

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a> The
            condition of Worms had been bad enough before, and when the news
            of Luther's murder reached the town the excitement passed all
            bounds. The whole of the Imperial Court was in an uproar. When
            Aleander was in the royal apartments the highest nobles in
            Germany pressed round him, telling him that he would be murdered
            even if he were <span class="tei tei-q">“clinging to the
            Emperor's bosom.”</span> Men crowded his room to give him
            information of conspiracies to slay both himself and the senior
            Legate Caraccioli.<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href=
            "#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a> The
            excitement abated somewhat, but the wiser German princes
            recognised the abiding gravity of the situation, and how little
            the Emperor's decision had done to end the Lutheran movement. The
            true story of Luther's disappearance was not known until long
            afterwards. After the failure of the conferences, the Elector of
            Saxony summoned two of his councillors and his chaplain and
            private secretary, Spalatin, and asked them to see that Luther
            was safely hidden until the immediate danger was past. They were
            to do what they pleased and inform him of nothing. Many weeks
            passed before the Elector and his brother John knew that Luther
            was safe, living in their own castle on the Wartburg. This was
            his <span class="tei tei-q">“Patmos,”</span> where he doffed his
            monkish robes, let the hair grow over his tonsure, was clad as a
            knight, and went by the name of Junker Georg. His disappearance
            did not mean that he ceased to be a great leader of men; but it
            dates the beginning of the national opposition to Rome.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After long
            delay, the imperial mandate against Luther was prepared. It was
            presented (May 25th) to an informal meeting of some members of
            the Diet after the Elector of Saxony and many of Luther's
            staunchest supporters had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            Aleander, who had a large share in drafting it, brought two
            copies, one in Latin and the other in German, and presented them
            to Charles on a Sunday (May 26th) after service. The Emperor
            signed them before leaving the church. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Are you contented now?”</span> said Charles, with a
            smile to the Legate; and Aleander overflowed with thanks. Few
            State documents, won by so much struggling and scheming, have
            proved so futile. The uproar in Germany at the report of Luther's
            death had warned the German princes to be chary of putting the
            edict into execution.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The imperial
            edict against Luther threatened all his sympathisers with
            extermination. It practically proclaimed an Albigensian war in
            Germany. Charles had handed it to Aleander with a smile. Aleander
            despatched the document to Rome with an exultation which could
            only find due expression in a quotation from Ovid's <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Art of
            Love</span></span>. Pope Leo celebrated the arrival of the news
            by comedies and musical entertainments. But calm observers,
            foreigners in Germany, saw little cause for congratulation and
            less for mirth. Henry <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">viii.</span></span> wrote to the
            Archbishop of Mainz congratulating him on the overthrow of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“rebel against Christ”</span>; but
            Wolsey's agent at the Diet informed his master that he believed
            there were one hundred thousand Germans who were still ready to
            lay down their lives in Luther's defence.<a id="noteref_294"

            Velasco, who had struck down the Spanish rebels in the battle of
            Villalar, wrote to the Emperor that the victory was God's
            gratitude for his dealings with the heretic monk; but Alfonso de
            Valdès, the Emperor's secretary, said in a letter to a Spanish
            correspondent:</p>

            <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

            Germans are greatly exasperated against the Roman See, and they
            do not seem to attach great importance to the Emperor's edicts;
            for since their publication, Luther's books are sold with
            impunity at every step and corner of the streets and
            market-places. From this you will easily guess what will happen
            when the Emperor leaves. This evil might have been cured with the
            greatest advantage to the Christian commonwealth, had not the
            Pope refused a General Council, had he preferred the public weal
            to his own private interests. But while he insists that Luther
            shall be condemned and burnt, I see the whole Christian
            commonwealth hurried to destruction unless God Himself help
            us.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Valdès, like
            Gattinara and other councillors of Charles, was a follower of
            Erasmus. He lays the blame of all on the Pope. But what a
            disillusion this Diet of Worms ought to have been to the
            Erasmians! The Humanist young sovereigns and the Humanist Pope,
            from whom so much had been expected, congratulating each other on
            Luther's condemnation to the stake!</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foreboding
            of Alfonso de Valdès was amply justified. Luther's books became
            more popular than ever, and the imperial edict did nothing to
            prevent their sale either within Germany or beyond it. Aleander
            was soon to learn this. He had retired to the Netherlands, and
            busied himself with <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">auto-da-fés</span></span> of the prohibited
            writings; but he had to confess that they were powerless to
            prevent the spread of Luther's opinions, and he declared that the
            only remedy would be if the Emperor seized and burnt half a dozen
            Lutherans, and confiscated all their property.<a id="noteref_295"

            edict had been published or repeated in lands outside Germany and
            in the family possessions of the House of Hapsburg. Henry

            edicts were easily evaded, and the prohibited writings found
            their way into Spain, Italy, France, Flanders, and elsewhere,
            concealed in bales of merchandise. In Germany there was no need
            for concealment; the imperial edict was not merely disregarded,
            but was openly scouted. The great Strassburg publisher, Gruniger,
            apologised to his customers, not for publishing Luther's books,
            but for sending forth a book against him; and Cochlæus declared
            that printers gladly accepted any MS. against the Papacy, printed
            it <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            spent pains in issuing it with taste, while every defender of the
            established order had to pay heavily to get his book printed, and
            sometimes could not secure a printer at any cost.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            Reformation movement may almost be said to have created the
            German book trade. The earliest German printed books or rather
            booklets were few in number, and of no great importance—little
            books of private devotion, of popular medicine, herbals,
            almanacs, travels, or public proclamations. Up to 1518 they
            barely exceeded fifty a year. But in the years 1518-1523 they
            increased enormously, and four-fifths of the increase were
            controversial writings prompted by the national antagonism to the
            Roman Curia. This increase was at first due to Luther
            alone;<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href=

            These writers spread the new ideas among the people, high and

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are few
            traces of combined action in the anti-Romanist writings in the
            earlier stages of the controversy; it needed literary opposition
            to give them a semblance of unity. Each writer looks at the
            general question from his own individual point of view. Luther is
            the hero with nearly all, and is spoken about in almost
            extravagant terms. He is the prophet of Germany, the Elias that
            was to come, the Angel of the Revelation <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“flying through the mid-heaven with the everlasting
            Gospel in his hands,”</span> the national champion who was
            brought to Worms to be silenced, and yet was heard by Emperor,
            princes, and papal nuncios. Some of the authors were still
            inclined to make Erasmus their leader, and declared that they
            were fighting under the banner of that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Knight of Christ”</span>; others looked on Erasmus
            and Luther as fellow-workers, and one homely pamphlet compares
            Erasmus to the miller who grinds the flour, and Luther to the
            baker who bakes it into bread to feed the people. Perhaps the
            most striking feature of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> the times was the appearance of numberless
            anonymous pamphlets, purporting to be written by the unlearned
            for the unlearned. They are mostly in the form of dialogues, and
            the scene of the conversations recorded was often the village
            alehouse, where burghers, peasants, weavers, tailors, and
            shoemakers attack and vanquish in argument priests, monks, and
            even bishops. One striking feature of this new popular literature
            is the glorification of the German peasant. He is always
            represented as an upright, simple-minded, reflective, and
            intelligent person skilled in Bible lore, and even in Church
            history, and knowing as much of Christian doctrine <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“as three priests and more.”</span> He may be
            compared with the idealised peasant of the pre-revolution
            literature in France, although he lacks the refinement, and knows
            nothing of high-flown moral sentiment; but he is much liker the
            Jak Upland or Piers Plowman of the days of the English Lollards.
            Jak Upland and Hans Mattock (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Karsthans</span></span>),
            both hate the clergy and abominate the monks and the begging
            friars, but the German exhibits much more ferocity than the
            Englishman. The Lollard describes the fat friar of the earlier
            English days with his swollen dewlap wagging under his chin
            <span class="tei tei-q">“like a great goose-egg,”</span> and
            contrasts him with the pale, poverty-stricken peasant and his
            wife, going shoeless to work over ice-bound roads, their steps
            marked with the blood which oozed from the cut feet; the German
            pamphleteer pours out an endless variety of savage
            nicknames—cheese-hunters, sausage-villains, begging-sacks,
            sourmilk crocks, the devil's fat pigs, etc. etc. It is
            interesting to note that most of this coarse controversial
            literature, which appeared between 1518 and 1523, came from those
            regions in South Germany where the social revolution had found an
            almost permanent establishment from the year 1503. It was the
            sign that the old spirit of communist and religious enthusiasm,
            which had shown itself spasmodically since the movement under
            Hans Böhm, had never been extinguished, and it was a symptom that
            a peasants' war might not be far off. Very little was needed to
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name=
            "Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> kindle afresh the
            smouldering hatred of the peasant against the priests. When
            German patriots declaimed against the exactions of the Roman
            Curia, the peasant thought of the great and lesser tithes, of the
            marriage, baptismal, and burial fees demanded from him by his own
            parish priest. When Reformers and popular preachers denounced the
            scandals and corruptions in the Church, the peasant applied them
            to some drunken, evil-living, careless priest whom he knew. It
            should be remembered that the character <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Karsthans</span></span> was invented in
            1520, not by a Lutheran sympathiser, but by Thomas Murner, one of
            Luther's most determined opponents,<a id="noteref_301" name=

            when he was still engaged in writing against the clerical
            disorders of the times. This virulent attack on priests and monks
            had other sources than the sympathy for Luther.<a id=

            was the awakening of old memories, prompted partly by an
            underground ceaseless Hussite propaganda, and partly, no doubt,
            by the new ideas so universally prevalent.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of this
            coarse popular literature had a more direct connection with the
            Lutheran movement. A booklet which appeared in 1521, entitled
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The New
            and the Old God</span></span>, and which had an immense
            circulation, may be taken as an example. Like many of its kind,
            it had an illustrated title-page, which was a graphic summary of
            its contents. There appeared as the representatives of the New
            God, the Pope, some Church Fathers, and beneath them, Cajetan,
            Silvester Prierias, Eck, and Faber; over-against them were the
            Old God as the Trinity, the four Evangelists, St. Paul with a
            sword, and behind him Luther. It attacked the ceremonies, the
            elaborate services, the obscure doctrines which had been thrust
            on the Church by bloody persecutions, and had <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id=
            "Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> changed Christianity into
            Judaism, and contrasted them with the unchanging Word of the Old
            God, with its simple story of salvation and its simple doctrines
            of faith, hope, and love. To the same class belong the writings
            of the voluminous controversialist, John Eberlin of Günzburg,
            whom his opponents accused of seducing whole provinces, so
            effective were his appeals to the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“common”</span> man. He began by a pamphlet addressed
            to the young Emperor, and published, either immediately before or
            during the earlier sitting of the Diet of Worms in 1521, a daring
            appeal, in which Luther and Ulrich von Hutten are called the
            messengers of God to their generation. It was the first of a
            series of fifteen, all of which were in circulation before the
            beginning of November of the same year.<a id="noteref_303" name=
            "noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class=

            They were called the <span class=

            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bundsgenossen</span></span>). The contents
            of these and other pamphlets by Eberlin may be guessed from their
            titles—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Of the forty days' fast before Easter and
            others which pitifully oppress Christian folk.</span></span>

            not wives</span></span> (the frontispiece represents the marriage
            of a priest by a bishop, in the background the marriage of two

            robbery of Germany to benefit the Roman Curia—300,000 gulden sent
            out of the country every year, and a million more given to the
            begging friars. He wrote fiercely against the monks who take to
            this life, because they were too lazy to work like honest people,
            and called them all sorts of nicknames—<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cloister
            swine</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            etc., twenty-four thousand of them sponge on Germany and four
            hundred thousand on the rest of Europe. He tells of a parish
            priest who thought that he must really begin to read the
            Scriptures: his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg
            305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            parishioners are reading it, the mothers to the children and the
            house-fathers to the household; they trouble him with questions
            taken from it, and he is often at his wit's end to answer; he
            asked a friend where he ought to begin, and was told that there
            was a good deal about priests and their duties in the Epistles to
            Timothy and Titus; he read, and was horrified to find that
            bishops and priests ought to be <span class="tei tei-q">“husbands
            of one wife,”</span> etc. Eberlin had been a Franciscan monk, and
            was true to the revolutionary traditions of his Order. He
            preached a social as well as an evangelical reformation. The
            Franciscan Order sent forth a good many Reformers: men like
            Stephen Kampen, who had come to adopt views like those of Eberlin
            without any teaching but the leadings of his heart; or John
            Brissmann, a learned student of the Scholastic Theology, who like
            Luther had found that it did not satisfy the yearnings of his
            soul; or like Frederick Mecum (Myconius), whose whole spiritual
            development was very similar to that of Luther. Pamphlets like
            those of Eberlin, and preaching like that of Kampen, had
            doubtless some influence in causing popular risings against the
            priests that were not uncommon throughout Germany in 1521, after
            the Diet of Worms had ended its sittings—the Erfurt tumult, which
            lasted during the months of April, May, June, and July, may be
            instanced as an example.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be said
            that the very year in which the imperial edict against Luther was
            published (1521) gave evidence that a silent movement towards the
            adoption of the principles for which Luther was testifying had
            begun among monks of almost all the different Orders. The
            Augustinian Eremites, Luther's own Order, had been largely
            influenced by him. Whole communities, with the prior at their
            head, had declared for the Reformation both in Germany and in the
            Low Countries. No other monastic Order was so decidedly upon the
            side of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg
            306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            Reformer, but monks of all kinds joined in preaching and teaching
            the new doctrines. Martin Bucer had been a Dominican, Otto
            Braunfells a Carthusian, Ambrose Blauer a Benedictine. The case
            of Oecolampadius (John Hussgen (?) Hausschein) was peculiar. He
            had been a distinguished Humanist, had come under serious
            religious impressions, and had entered the Order of St. Bridget;
            but he was not long there when he joined the ranks of the
            Reformers, and was sheltered by Franz von Sickingen in his castle
            at Ebernberg.<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href=
            "#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a>
            Urban Rhegius, John Eck's most trusted and most talented student
            at Ingolstadt, had become a Carmelite, and had quitted his
            monastery to preach the doctrines of Luther. John Bugenhagen
            belonged to the Order of the Præmonstratenses. He was a learned
            theologian. Luther's struggle against Indulgences had displeased
            him. He got hold of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">The Babylonian Captivity of the Christian
            Church</span></span>, and studied it for the purpose of refuting
            it. The study so changed him that he felt that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the whole world may be wrong, but Luther is
            right”</span>; he won over his prior and most of his companions,
            and became the Reformer of Pomerania.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Secular
            priests all over Germany declared for the new evangelical
            doctrines. The Bishop of Samlund in East Prussia boldly avowed
            himself to be on Luther's side, and was careful to have the
            Lutheran doctrines preached throughout his diocese; and other
            bishops showed themselves favourable to the new evangelical
            faith. Many of the most influential parish priests did the like,
            and their congregations followed them. Sometimes the superior
            clergy forbade the use of the church, and the people followed
            their pastor while he preached to them in the fields. Sometimes
            (as in the case of Hermann Tast) the priest preached under the
            lime trees in the churchyard, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> his parishioners came armed to protect him.
            If priests were lacking to preach the Lutheran doctrines, laymen
            came forward. If they could not preach, they could sing hymns.
            Witness the poor weaver of Magdeburg, who took his stand near the
            statue of Kaiser Otto in the market-place, and sang two of
            Luther's hymns, <span class="tei tei-q">“Aus tiefer Not schrei
            Ich zu dir,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Es woll' uns
            Gott gnädig sein,”</span> while the people crowded round him on
            the morning of May 6th, 1524. The Burgermeister coming from early
            Mass heard him, and ordered him to be imprisoned, but the crowd
            rescued him. Such was the beginning of the Reformation in
            Magdeburg.<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href=
            "#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            When men dared not, women took their place. Argula Grunbach, a
            student of the Scriptures and of Luther's writings, challenged
            the University of Ingolstadt, under the eyes of the great Dr. Eck
            himself, to a public disputation upon the truth of Luther's
            position.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Artists lent
            their aid to spread the new ideas, and many cartoons made the
            doctrines and the aims of the Reformers plain to the common
            people. These pictures were sometimes used to illustrate the
            title-pages of the controversial literature, and were sometimes
            published as separate broadsides. In one, Christ is portrayed
            standing at the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">door</span></em> of a house, which
            represents His Church. He invites the people to enter by the
            door; and Popes, cardinals, and monks are shown climbing the

            folk of a German town are represented singing songs of welcome to
            honour an approaching procession. Moses, the patriarchs, the
            prophets, and the apostles, carry on their shoulders the Ark of
            the Holy Scriptures. Hutten comes riding on his warhorse, and to
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name=
            "Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the tail of the
            horse is attached a chain which encloses a crowd of
            ecclesiastics—an archbishop with his mitre fallen off, the Pope
            with his tiara in the act of tumbling and his pontifical staff
            broken; after them, cardinals, then monks figured with the heads
            of cats, pigs, calves, etc. Then comes a triumphal car drawn by
            the four living creatures, who represent the four evangelists, on
            one of which rides an angel. Carlstadt stands upright in the
            front of the car; Luther strides alongside. In the car, Jesus
            sits saying, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">I am the Way, and the Truth, and the
            Life</span></em>. Holy martyrs follow, singing songs of praise.
            German burghers are spreading their garments on the road, and
            boys and girls are strewing the path with flowers.<a id=

            Perhaps the most important work of this kind was the <span class=

            Luther planned the book, Luke Cranach designed the pictures, and
            Melanchthon furnished the texts from Scripture and the quotations
            from Canon Law. It is a series of pairs of engravings
            representing the lives of our Lord and of the Pope, so arranged
            that wherever the book opened two contrasting pictures could be
            seen at the same time. The contrasts were such as these:—Jesus
            washing the disciples' feet; the Pope holding out his toe to be
            kissed: Jesus healing the wounded and the sick; the Pope
            presiding at a tournament: Jesus bending under His Cross; the
            Pope carried in state on men's shoulders: Jesus driving the
            money-changers out of the Temple; the Pope and his servants
            turning a church into a market for Indulgences, and sitting
            surrounded with strong boxes and piles of coin. It was a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“good book for the laity,”</span> Luther
            said.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the
            signs of the times was the enthusiasm displayed in the imperial
            cities for the cause of Luther. The way had been prepared.
            Burgher songs had for long described the ecclesiastical abuses,
            and had borne witness <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg
            309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            to the widespread hatred of the clergy shared in by the
            townsfolk. Wolfgang Capito and Frederick Mecum (Myconius), both
            sons of burghers, inform us that their fathers taught them when
            they were boys that Indulgences were nothing but a speculation on
            the part of cunning priests to get their hands into the pockets
            of simple-minded laity. Keen observers of the trend of public
            feeling like Wimpheling and Pirkheimer had noticed with some
            alarm the gradual spread of the Hussite propaganda in the towns,
            and had made the fact one of their reasons for desiring and
            insisting on a reformation of the Church. The growing sympathy
            for the Hussite opinions in the cities is abundantly apparent.
            Some leading Reformers, Capito for instance, told their
            contemporaries that they had frequently listened to Hussite
            discourses when they were boys; and the libraries of burghers not
            infrequently contained Hussite pamphlets. Men in the towns had
            been reading, thinking, and speaking in private to their familiar
            friends about the disorders in the life and doctrine of the
            Church of their days, and were eager to welcome the first
            symptoms of a genuine attempt at reform.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The number of
            editions of the German Vulgate, rude as many of these versions
            were, shows what a Bible-reading people the German burghers had
            become, enables us to wonder less at the way in which the
            controversial writers assume that the laity knew as much of the
            Scriptures as the clergy, and lends credibility to contemporary
            assertions that women and artisans knew their Bibles better than
            learned men at the Universities.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These things
            make us understand how the townsmen were prepared to welcome
            Luther's simple scriptural teaching, how his writings found such
            a sale all over Germany, how they could say that he taught what
            all men had been thinking, and said out boldly what all men had
            been whispering in private. They explain how the burghers of
            Strassburg nailed Luther's Ninety-five Theses to the doors of
            every church and parsonage in the city in 1518; how the citizens
            of Constance drove away with <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            publish the Edict of Worms in their town; how the people of Basel
            applauded their pastor when he carried a copy of the Scriptures
            instead of the Host in the procession on Corpus Christi Day; how
            the higher clergy of Strassburg could not expel the nephew and
            successor of the famed Geiler of Keysersberg although he was
            accused of being a follower of Luther; and how his friend Matthew
            Zell, when he was prohibited from preaching in the pulpit from
            which Geiler had thundered, was able to get carpenters to erect
            another in a corner of the great cathedral, from which he spoke
            to the people who crowded to hear him. When the clergy persuaded
            the authorities in many towns (Goslar, Danzig, Worms, etc.) to
            close the churches against the evangelical preachers, the
            townspeople listened to their sermons in the open air; but
            generally from the first the civic authorities sided with the
            people in welcoming a powerful evangelical preacher. Matthew Zell
            and, after him, Martin Bucer became the Reformers of Strassburg;
            Kettenbach and Eberlin, of Ulm; Oecolampadius and Urbanus
            Rhegius, of Augsburg; Andrew Osiander, of Nürnberg; John Brenz,
            of Hall, in Swabia; Theobald Pellicanus (Pellicanus, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
            of Villigheim), of Nördlingen; Matthew Alber, of Reutlingen; John
            Lachmann, of Heilbron; John Wanner, of Constance; and so on. The
            gilds of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Mastersingers</span></span> welcomed the
            Reformation. The greatest of the civic poets, Hans Sachs of
            Nürnberg, was a diligent collector and reader of Luther's books.
            He published in 1523 his famous poem, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The Wittenberg Nightingale”</span> (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Die Wittembergisch
            Nachtigall, Die man jetz höret überall</span></span>). The
            nightingale was Luther, and its song told that the moonlight with
            its pale deceptive gleams and its deep shadows was passing away,
            and the glorious sun was rising. The author praises the utter
            simplicity of Luther's scriptural teaching, and contrasts it with
            the quirks and subtleties of Romish doctrine. Even a peasant, he
            says, can understand and know that Luther's teaching is good and
            sound. In a later short poem he contrasts <span class=

            "Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> evangelical and Romish
            preaching. The original edition was illustrated by a woodcut
            showing two preachers addressing their respective audiences. The
            one is saying, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every great
            movement for reform bears within it the seeds of revolution, of
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“tumult,”</span> as Erasmus called
            it, and Luther's was no exception to the general rule. Every
            Reformer who would carry through his reforming ideas successfully
            has to struggle against men and circumstances making for the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“tumult,”</span> almost as strenuously as
            against the abuses he seeks to overcome. We have already seen how
            these germs of revolution abounded in Germany, and how the
            revolutionists naturally allied themselves with the Reformer, and
            the cause he sought to promote.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Luther
            was hidden away in the Wartburg, the revolution seized on
            Wittenberg. At first his absence did not seem to make any
            difference. The number of students had increased until it was
            over a thousand, and the town itself surprised eye-witnesses who
            were acquainted with other University towns in Germany. The
            students went about unarmed; they mostly carried Bibles under
            their arms; they saluted each other as <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“brothers at one in Christ.”</span> No rift had yet
            appeared among the band of leaders, although his disappointment
            in not obtaining the Provostship of All Saints had begun to
            isolate Andrew Bodenstein of Carlstadt. Unanimity did not mean
            dulness; Wittenberg was seething with intellectual life. Since
            its foundation the University had been distinguished for weekly
            Public Disputations in which students and professors took part.
            In the earlier years of its existence the theses discussed had
            been suggested by the Scholastic Theology and Philosophy in
            vogue; but since 1518 the new questions which were stirring
            Germany had been the subjects of debate, and this had given a
            life and eagerness to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> University exercises. When Justus Jonas
            came to Wittenberg from Erfurt, he wrote enthusiastically to a
            friend about the <span class="tei tei-q">“unbelievable wealth of
            spiritual interests in the little town of Wittenberg.”</span>
            None of the professors took a keener interest in these Public
            Discussions than Andrew Bodenstein of Carlstadt. He had been a
            very successful teacher; had come under Luther's magnetic
            influence; and had accepted the main ideas of the new doctrines.
            He had not the full-blooded humanity of Luther, nor his
            sympathetic tact, nor his practical insight into how things would
            work. He lacked altogether Luther's solid basis of conservative
            feeling, which made him know by instinct that new ideas and new
            things could only flourish and grow if they were securely rooted
            in what was old. It was enough for Carlstadt that his own ideas,
            however hastily evolved, were clear, and his aims beneficent, to
            make him eager to see them at once reduced to practice. He had
            the temperament of a revolutionary rather than that of a
            Reformer.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was
            strongly impressed with the fundamental contradictions which he
            believed to exist between the new evangelical doctrines preached
            by Luther and the theories and practices of the mediæval
            religious life and worship. This led him to attack earnestly and
            bitterly monastic vows, celibacy, a distinctive dress for the
            clergy, the idea of a propitiatory sacrifice in the Mass, and the
            presence and use of images and pictures in the churches. He
            introduced all these questions of practical interest into the
            University weekly Public Discussions; he published theses upon
            them; he printed two books—one on monastic vows and the other on
            the Mass—which had an extensive circulation both in German and in
            Latin (four editions were speedily exhausted). The prevailing
            idea in all these publications, perhaps implied rather than
            expressed, was that the new evangelical liberty could only be
            exercised when everything which suggested the ceremonies and
            usages of the mediæval religious life was swept away. His
            strongest denunciations were reserved for the practice of
            celibacy; he dwelt on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> divine institution of marriage, its moral
            and spiritual necessity, and taught that the compulsory marriage
            of the clergy was better than the enforced celibacy of the
            mediæval Church. Zwilling, a young Augustinian Eremite, whose
            preaching gifts had been praised by Luther, went even further
            than Carlstadt in his fiery denunciation of the Mass as an
            idolatrous practice.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The movement
            to put these exhortations in practice began first among the
            clergy. Two priests in parishes near Wittenberg married; several
            monks left their cloisters and donned lay garments; Melanchthon
            and several of his students, in semi-public fashion, communicated
            in both kinds in the parish church on Michaelmas Day (Sept.
            29th), 1521, and his example seems to have been followed by other
            companies.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Zwilling's
            fiery denunciations of the idolatry of the Mass stirred the
            commonalty of the town. On Christmas Eve (Dec. 24-25), 1521, a
            turbulent crowd invaded the parish church and the Church of All
            Saints. In the former they broke the lamps, threatened the
            priests, and in mockery of the worship of praise they sang
            folk-songs, one of which began: <span class="tei tei-q">“There
            was a maid who lost a shoe”</span>—so the indignant clergy
            complained to the Elector.<a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310"
            href="#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next day,
            Christmas, Carlstadt, who was archdeacon, conducted the service
            in All Saints' Church. He had doffed his clerical robes, and wore
            the ordinary dress of a layman. He preached and then dispensed
            the Lord's Supper in an <span class="tei tei-q">“evangelical
            fashion.”</span> He read the usual service, but omitted
            everything which taught a propitiatory sacrifice; he did not
            elevate the Host; and he placed the Bread in the hands of every
            communicant, and gave the Cup into their hands. On the following
            Sundays and festival days the Sacrament of the Supper was
            dispensed in the same manner, and we are told that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“hic pæne urbs et cuncta civitas communicavit sub
            utraque specie.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            "tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the
            closing days of the year 1521, so full of excitement for the
            people of Wittenberg, three men, known in history as the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zwickau
            Prophets</span></span>, came to the town (Dec. 27th). Zwickau,
            lying about sixty-four miles south of Wittenberg, was the centre
            of the weaving trade of Saxony, and contained a large artisan
            population. We have seen that movements of a
            religious-communistic kind had from time to time appeared among
            the German artisans and peasants since 1476. Nicolaus Storch, a
            weaver in Zwickau, proclaimed that he had visions of the Angel
            Gabriel, who had revealed to him: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou
            shalt sit with me on my throne.”</span> He began to preach.
            Thomas Münzer, who had been appointed by the magistrates to be
            town preacher in St. Mary's, the principal church in Zwickau,
            praised his discourses, declaring that Storch expounded the
            Scriptures better than any priest. Some writers have traced the
            origin of this Zwickau movement to Hussite teachings. Münzer
            allied himself with the extreme Hussites <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after</span></em>
            the movement had begun, and paid a visit to Bohemia, taking with
            him some of his intimates; but our sources of information, which
            are scanty, do not warrant any decided opinion about the origin
            of the outbreak in Zwickau. After some time Storch and others
            were forced to leave the town. Three of them went to
            Wittenberg—Storch himself, the seer of heavenly visions, another
            weaver, and Marcus Thomä Stubner, who had once been a pupil of
            Melanchthon, and was therefore able to introduce his companions
            to the Wittenberg circle of Reformers. Their arrival and
            addresses increased the excitement both in the town and in the
            University. Melanchthon welcomed his old pupil, and was impressed
            by the presence of a certain spiritual power in Stubner and in
            his companions. Some of their doctrines, however, especially
            their rejection of infant baptism, repelled him, and he gradually
            withdrew from their companionship.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carlstadt took
            advantage of the strong excitement in Wittenberg to press on the
            townspeople and on the magistrates his scheme of reformation; and
            on Jan. 24th, 1522, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg
            315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the authorities of the town of Wittenberg published their famous
            ordinance.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This document,
            the first of numerous civic and territorial attempts to express
            the new evangelical ideas in legislation, deserves careful
            study.<a id="noteref_311" name="noteref_311" href=
            "#note_311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a> It
            concerns itself almost exclusively with the reform of social life
            and of public worship. It enjoins the institution of a common
            chest to be under the charge of two of the magistrates, two of
            the townsmen, and a public notary. Into this the revenues from
            ecclesiastical foundations were to be placed, the annual revenues
            of the guilds of workmen, and other specified monies. Definite
            salaries were to be paid to the priests, and support for the poor
            and for the monks was to be taken from this common fund. Begging,
            whether by ordinary beggars, monks, or poor students, was
            strictly prohibited. If the common chest was not able to afford
            sufficient for the support of the helpless and orphans, the
            townsfolk had to provide what was needed. No houses of ill-fame
            were allowed within the town. Churches were places for preaching;
            the town contained enough for the population; and the building of
            small chapels was prohibited. The service of the Mass was
            shortened, and made to express the evangelical meaning of the
            sacrament, and the elements were to be placed in the hands of the
            communicants. All this was made law within the town of
            Wittenberg; and the reformation was to be enforced. Not content
            with these regulations, Carlstadt engaged in a crusade against
            the use of pictures and images in the churches (the regulations
            had permitted three altars in every church and one picture for
            each altar). Everything which recalled the older religious usages
            was to be done away with, and flesh was to be eaten on fast
            days.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
            excitement bred fanaticism. Voices were raised <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id=
            "Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> declaring that, as all true
            Christians were taught by the Spirit of God, there was no need
            either for civil rulers or for carnal learning. It is believed by
            many that Carlstadt shared these fancies, and it has been said
            that in his desire to <span class="tei tei-q">“simplify”</span>
            himself, he dressed as a peasant and worked as a labourer (he had
            married) on his father-in-law's farm. It is more probable that he
            found himself unable to rule the storm his hasty measures had
            raised, and that he saw many things proposed with which he had no
            sympathy.</p>

            himself could quell the excitement, and eagerly pressed his
            return. The revolutionary movement was extending beyond
            Wittenberg, in other towns in Electoral Saxony such as Grimma and
            Altenberg. Duke George of Saxony, the strenuous defender of the
            old faith, had been watching the proceedings from the beginning.
            As early as Nov. 21st, 1521, he had written to John Duke of
            Saxony, the brother of the Elector, warning him that, against
            ecclesiastical usage, the Sacrament of the Supper was being
            dispensed in both kinds in Wittenberg; he had informed him (Dec.
            26th) that priests were threatened while saying the Mass; he had
            brought the <span class="tei tei-q">“tumultuous deeds”</span> in
            Electoral Saxony before the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span> in January,
            with the result that imperial mandates were sent to the Elector
            Frederick and to the Bishops of Meissen, Merseburg, and Naumburg,
            requiring them to take measures to end the disturbances. The
            Elector was seriously disquieted. His anxieties were increased by
            a letter from Duke George (Feb. 2nd, 1522), declaring that
            Carlstadt and Zwilling were the instigators of all the riotous
            proceedings. He had commissioned one of his councillors, Hugold
            of Einsiedel, to try to put matters right; but the result had
            been small. It was probably in these circumstances that he wrote
            his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            yet, like many another edict of Emperor and Diet, it was wholly
            ineffective. It could only be enforced by the individual Estates,
            who for the most part showed great reluctance to put it into
            operation. It was published in the territories of Archduke
            Ferdinand of Austria, of the Elector of Brandenburg, of Duke
            George of Saxony, and of the Dukes of Bavaria; but none of these
            princes, except the Archduke and Duke George, seemed to care much
            for the old religion. In most of the ecclesiastical States the
            authorities were afraid of riots following the publication,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name=
            "Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and did nothing.
            Thus, in Bremen, we are told that as late as December 1522 the
            people had never seen the edict. The cities treated it as
            carelessly. The authorities in Nürnberg, Ulm, Augsburg, and
            Strassburg posted it up publicly as an official document, and
            took no further trouble. In Strassburg the printers went on
            issuing Luther's books and tracts as fast as their
            printing-presses could produce them; and at Constance the
            populace drove the imperial commissioners from the town when they
            came to publish the edict.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The action of
            the newly constituted <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span> was as
            indecisive. When the disturbances broke out at Wittenberg, under
            Carlstadt and the Zwickau Prophets, Duke George, by playing on
            the fears of a spread of Hussitism, could get mandates issued to
            the Elector of Saxony and neighbouring bishops to inquire into
            and crush the disorders; but after Luther's return and the
            restoration of tranquillity his pleadings were ineffectual. It
            was in vain that he insisted that Luther's presence in Wittenberg
            was an insult to the Empire. He was told that the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span> was able to
            judge for itself what were insults, and that when they saw them
            they would punish. Archduke Ferdinand, the President, doubtless
            sympathised with Duke George, but he was powerless; the Elector
            of Saxony had the greatest influence, and it was always exerted
            on the side of Luther.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In January
            1522 a new Pope had been chosen, who took the title of Adrian
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vi</span></span>. His election was a
            triumph for the party that confessed the urgent need of reforms,
            and thought that they ought to be effected by the hierarchy and
            from within the Church. Adrian was a pious man according to his
            lights, one who felt deeply the corruption which was degrading
            the Church. He believed that the revolt of Luther was a
            punishment sent by God for the sins of the generation. He had
            been the tutor of Charles <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">v.</span></span>, and ascended the
            papal throne with the determination to reform corruptions, and to
            begin his reforms by attacking the source of all—the Roman Curia.
            But he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg
            321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            was a Dominican monk, and had all the Dominican ideas about the
            need of maintaining mediæval theology intact, and about the
            strict maintenance of ecclesiastical discipline. He was as
            ignorant as his predecessor of the state of matters in Germany,
            and regarded Luther as another Mahomet, who was seducing men from
            the higher Christian life by pandering to their fleshly
            appetites.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span> met with the
            Diet at Nürnberg in 1522-1523, and to this Diet the Pope sent, as
            nuncio, Francesco Chieregati, Bishop of Terramo, in the kingdom
            of Naples. The nuncio was given lengthy instructions, which set
            forth the Pope's opinion of the corruptions in the Church and his
            intention to cure them, but which demanded the delivery of Luther
            into the hands of the Roman Curia, and the punishment of priests,
            monks, and nuns who had broken their vows of celibacy.<a id=

            Chieregati was no sooner in Germany than he understood that it
            would be impossible for him to get the Pope's demand carried out,
            and he informed his master of the state of matters. When he met
            the Diet and presented the papal requests, he was practically
            answered that Germany had grievances against Rome, and that they
            would need to be set right ere the Curia could expect to get its
            behests fulfilled. They intimated that since the Pope had
            admitted the corruptions in the Church, it was scarcely to be
            expected that they should blame Luther for having pointed them
            out. They presented the nuncio with a list of one hundred German
            grievances against the Roman Curia;<a id="noteref_317" name=
            "noteref_317" href="#note_317"><span class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a> and
            suggested that the most convenient way of settling them would be
            for the Pope to make over immediately, for the public use of
            Germany, the German <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

            that a German Council should be held on German soil, and within
            one of the larger German cities.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The practical
            result of this fencing at the Diet of 1522, repeated in 1523, was
            that the progress of the Lutheran movement was not checked. How
            deeply the people of Germany had drunk in the teaching of Luther
            may be learnt from the letters of the nuncio to the Curia, and
            from those of the Archduke Ferdinand to the Emperor. Both use the
            same expression, that <span class="tei tei-q">“among a thousand
            men scarcely one could be found untainted by Lutheran
            teaching.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Adrian
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vi.</span></span> died suddenly after
            a few months' reign, and the next Pope, Clement <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">vii.</span></span>, a Medici and
            completely under the influence of the French king, belonged to
            the old unreforming party, whose only desire was to maintain all
            the corrupting privileges of the Roman Curia. He selected and
            sent to Germany, as his nuncio, Lorenzo Campeggio, one of the
            ablest of Italian diplomatists, to negotiate with the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span> and the Diet
            which met at Speyer in 1524.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Campeggio,
            like his predecessor, found that the German Nation was
            determinedly hostile to Rome. When he made his official entry
            into Augsburg, and raised his hands to give the usual benediction
            to the crowds of people, they received the blessing with open
            derision. He was so impressed with their attitude, that when he
            reached Nürnberg he doffed his official robes and entered the
            town as quietly as possible; indeed he received a message from
            the authorities asking him <span class="tei tei-q">“to avoid
            making the sign of the cross, or using the benediction, seeing
            how matters then stood.”</span> The presence of the Legate seemed
            to increase the anti-papal zeal of the people. The Pope was
            openly spoken of as Antichrist. Planitz, the energetic commissary
            of the Elector of Saxony, reckoned that nearly four thousand
            people in the city partook of the Sacrament of the Supper in both
            kinds, and informs us that among them were members of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span>, and Isabella,
            Queen of Sweden, the sister of the Emperor.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet the
            experienced Italian diplomatist thought that he could discern
            signs more favourable to his master than <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class=

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span>, which had
            hitherto shielded the Lutheran movement, had lost the confidence
            of many classes of people, and was tottering to its fall. It had
            showed itself unable to enforce the Lands-Peace. It was the
            princes who had defeated the rising of the Free Nobles under
            Franz von Sickingen; it was the Swabian League, an association
            always devoted to the House of Austria, that had crushed the
            Franconian robber nobles; and both princes and League were
            irritated at the attempts of the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span>, which had
            endeavoured to rob them of the fruits of their successes. The
            cities had been made to bear all the taxation needed to support
            the central government, and the system of monopolies arising from
            combinations among the great commercial houses had been
            threatened. The cities and the capitalists had made a secret
            agreement with the Emperor, and von Hannart had been sent by the
            Emperor from Spain to the Diet of 1524 to work along with the
            towns for the overthrow of the central government. The Diet
            itself had passed a vote of no confidence in the government. In
            these troubled waters a crafty fisher might win some success.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His success
            was more apparent than real. The Diet of 1524 did not absolutely
            refuse to enforce the Edict of Worms against Luther and his
            followers; they promised to execute it <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“as well as they were able, and as far as was
            possible,”</span> and the cities had made it plain that the
            enforcement was impossible. They renewed their demand for a
            General Council to meet in a suitable German town to settle the
            affairs of the Church in Germany, and again declared that
            meanwhile nothing should be preached contrary to the Word of God
            and the Holy Gospel. They went further, and practically resolved
            that a National Council, to deliberate on the condition of the
            Church in Germany, should meet at Speyer in November and make an
            interim settlement of its ecclesiastical affairs, to last until
            the meeting of a General Council. It is true that, owing to the
            exertions of the nuncio and of von Hannart, the phrase National
            Synod was omitted, and the meeting <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> was to be one of the Estates of Germany at
            which the councillors and learned divines of the various princes
            were to formulate all the disputed points, and to consider anew
            the grievances of the German nation against the Papacy; but
            neither the nuncio nor von Hannart deceived themselves as to the
            real meaning of the resolution. <span class="tei tei-q">“It will
            be a National Council for Germany,”</span> said Hannart in his
            report. Nothing could be more alarming to the Pope. There was
            always a possibility of managing a General Council; but a German
            National Synod, including a large number of lay representatives,
            meeting in a German town, foreshadowed an independent National
            German Church which would insist on separation from the Roman
            See. The Pope wrote to Henry <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">viii.</span></span>
            of England asking him to harass the German merchants; he induced
            the Emperor to forbid the proposed meeting of the German States;
            and, what was more important, he instructed his nuncio to take
            steps secretly to form a league of German princes who were still
            favourable to maintaining the mediæval Church with its doctrines,
            ceremonies, and usages. This inaugurated the religious divisions
            of Germany.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Diet of
            Speyer (1524) may perhaps be taken as the beginning of the
            separation of Germany into two opposite camps of Protestant and
            Roman Catholic, although the real parting of the ways actually
            occurred after the Peasants' War. The overthrow, or at least
            discrediting of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span>, placed the
            management of everything, including the settlement of the
            religious question, in the hands of the princes, none of whom,
            with the exception of the Elector of Saxony, cared much for the
            idea of nationality; while some of them, however anxious they
            were, or once had been, for ecclesiastical reforms, were
            genuinely afraid of the <span class="tei tei-q">“tumult”</span>
            which they believed might lurk behind any conspicuous changes in
            religious usages. Duke George of Saxony, who was keenly alive to
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name=
            "Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the corruptions in
            the Church, dreaded above all things the beginnings of a Hussite
            movement in Germany. He knew that an assiduous, penetrating,
            secret Hussite, or rather Taborite propaganda had been going on
            in Germany for long. As early as the Leipzig Disputation (1519),
            when John Eck had skilfully forced Luther into the avowal that he
            approved of some things in the Hussite revolt, Duke George was
            seen to put his arms akimbo, to wag his long beard, and was heard
            to ejaculate, <span class="tei tei-q">“God help us! The
            plague!”</span> A fear of Hussite revolution displays itself in
            his correspondence, and very notably in his letters to Duke John
            of Saxony and to the Elector about the disturbances in
            Wittenberg. It was a triumph for the Roman Curia when its
            partisans, from Eck onwards, were able to fix the stigma of
            Hussitism on the Lutheran movement; and the career of the Zwickau
            Prophets, notwithstanding their suppression by Luther, was, to
            many, an indication of what might lie behind the new preaching.
            When the Peasants' War came in 1525, many of the earlier
            sympathisers with Luther saw in it an indication of the dangers
            into which they fancied that Luther was leading Germany. It is
            also to be noticed that many of the Humanists now began to desert
            the Lutheran cause; his Augustinian theology made them think that
            he was bent on creating a new Scholastic which seemed to them
            almost as bad as the old, which they had been delighted to see
            him attack.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Roman
            Curia was quick to take advantage of all these alarms. Its
            efforts were so successful, that it was soon able to create a
            Roman Catholic Party among the South German princes, and to
            secure its steadfastness by promising a few concessions, and by
            permitting the authorities to retain for the secular uses of
            their States about one-fifth of the ecclesiastical revenues in
            each State. The leading States in this Roman Catholic federation
            were Austria and Bavaria, and so long as Duke George lived, Ducal
            Saxony in middle Germany. This naturally called forth a
            distinctly Lutheran party, no longer national, which included the
            Elector of Saxony, the Landgrave of Hesse, the Margraf
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name=
            "Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Brandenburg,
            his brother Albert, and many others. Albert was at the head of
            the Teutonic Order in East Prussia. He secularised his
            semi-ecclesiastical principality, became the first Duke of
            Prussia, and his State from the beginning adopted the evangelical
            faith.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not
            until the Peasants' War was over that this division was clearly
            manifested. The Reformation had spread in simple natural fashion,
            without any attempt at concerted action, or any design to impose
            a new and uniform order of public worship, or to make changes in
            ecclesiastical government. Luther himself was not without hopes
            that the great ecclesiastical principalities might become secular
            lordships, that the bishops would assume the lead in
            ecclesiastical reform, and that there would be a great National
            Church in Germany, with little external change—enough only to
            permit the evangelical preaching and teaching. It is true that
            the Emperor had shown clearly his position by sending martyrs to
            the stake in the Netherlands, and that symptoms of division had
            begun to manifest themselves during 1524, as we have seen. Still
            these things did not prevent such an experienced statesman as the
            Elector of Saxony from confidently expecting a peaceful and, so
            far as Germany was concerned, a unanimous and hearty solution of
            the religious difficulties. The storm burst suddenly which was to
            shatter these optimistic expectations, and to change
            fundamentally the whole course of the Lutheran Reformation. This
            was the Peasants' War.</p>

            had been almost chronic in Germany during the later decades of
            the fifteenth and in the beginning of the sixteenth century. All

            were increasingly active in 1524-1525. It is easy to show, as
            many Lutheran Church historians have done with elaborate care,
            that the Reformation under Luther had nothing in common with the
            sudden and unexpected revolt,—as easy as to prove that there was
            little in common between the <span class="tei tei-q">“Spiritual
            Poverty”</span> of Francis of Assisi and the vulgar communism of
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Brethren and Sisters of the Free
            Spirit</span></span>, between the doctrines of Wiclif and the
            gigantic labour strike headed by Wat Tyler and Priest Ball,
            between the teaching of Huss and the extreme Taborite fanatics.
            But the fact remains that the voice of Luther awoke echoes
            whereof he never dreamt, and that its effects cannot be measured
            by some changes in doctrine, or by a reformation in
            ecclesiastical organisation. The times of the Reformation were
            ripe for revolution, and the words of the bold preacher, coming
            when all men were restless and most men were oppressed, appealing
            especially to those who felt the burden heavy and the yoke
            galling, were followed by far-resounding reverberations. Besides,
            Luther's message was democratic. It destroyed the aristocracy of
            the saints, it levelled the barriers between the layman and the
            priest, it taught the equality of all men before God, and the
            right of every man of faith to stand in God's presence whatever
            be his rank and condition of life. He had not confined himself to
            preaching a new theology. His message was eminently practical. In
            his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">the
            Nobility of the German Nation</span></span>, Luther had voiced
            all the grievances of Germany, had touched upon almost all the
            open sores of the time, and had foretold disasters not very far
            off.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor must it be
            forgotten that no great leader ever flung about wild words in
            such a reckless way. Luther had the gift of strong smiting
            phrases, of words which seemed to cleave to the very heart of
            things, of images which lit up a subject with the vividness of a
            flash of lightning. He launched tracts and pamphlets from the
            press about almost everything,—written for the most part on the
            spur of the moment, and when the fire burned. His words fell into
            souls full of the fermenting passions of the times. They drank in
            with eagerness the thoughts that all men were equal before God,
            and that there are divine commands about the brotherhood of
            mankind of more importance than all human legislation. They
            refused to believe that such golden ideas belonged to the realm
            of spiritual life alone, or that the only prescriptions which
            denied the rights of the common man were the decrees of the Roman
            Curia. The successful revolts of the Swiss peasants, the
            wonderful victories of Zisca, the people's leader, in the near
            Bohemian lands, were illustrations, they thought, of how Luther's
            sledge-hammer words could be translated into corresponding
            deeds.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Other
            teachings besides Luther's were listened to. Many of the
            Humanists, professed disciples of Plato, expounded to friends or
            in their class-rooms the communistic dreams of the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Utopias</span></span> like the brilliant
            sketch of the ideal commonwealth which came from the pen of
            Thomas More. These speculations <span class="tei tei-q">“of the
            Chair”</span> were listened to by the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“wandering students,”</span> and were retailed, with
            forcible illustrations, in a way undreamt of by their scholarly
            authors, to audiences of artisans and peasants who were more than
            ready to give them unexpected applications.<a id="noteref_321"

            of popular astrology must not be forgotten; for the astrologists
            were powerful among all classes of society, in the palaces of the
            princes, in the houses of the burghers, and at the peasant market
            gatherings and church ales. In these days they were busy pointing

            missionaries of the movement belonged to all sorts and conditions
            of men—poor priests sympathising with the grievances of their
            parishioners; wandering monks who had deserted their convents,
            especially those belonging to the Franciscan Order; poor students
            on their way from University to University; artisans, travelling
            in German fashion from one centre of their trade to another. They
            found their audiences on the village greens under the lime trees,
            or in the public-houses in the lower parts of the towns. They
            talked the rude language of the people, and garnished their
            discourse with many a scriptural quotation. They read to excited
            audiences small pamphlets and broadsides, printed in thick
            letters on coarse paper, which discussed the burning questions of
            the day.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The revolt
            began unexpectedly, and without any pre-concerted preparation or
            formulation of demands, in June 1524, when a thousand peasants
            belonging to the estate of Count Sigismund of Lupfen rose in
            rebellion against their lord at Stühlingen, a few miles to the
            north-west of Schaffhausen, and put themselves under the
            leadership of Hans Müller, an old landsknecht. Müller led his
            peasants, one of them carrying a flag blazoned with the imperial
            colours of red, black, and yellow, to the little town of
            Waldshut, about half-way between Schaffhausen and Basel. The
            people of the town fraternised with the peasants, and the
            formidable <span class="tei tei-q">“Evangelical
            Brotherhood”</span> was either formed then or the roots of it
            were planted. The news spread fast, east and west. The peasants
            of the districts round about the Lake of Constance—in the Allgau,
            the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name=
            "Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Klettgau, the
            Hegau, and Villingen—rose in rebellion. The revolt spread
            northwards into Lower Swabia, and the peasants of Leiphen, led by
            Jacob Wehe, were joined by some of the troops of Truchsess, the
            general of the Swabian League. The peasants of Salzburg, Styria,
            and the Tyrol rose. These three eastern risings had most staying
            power in them. The Salzburg peasants besieged the Cardinal
            Archbishop in his castle; they were not reduced till the spring
            of 1526, and only after having extorted concessions from their
            over-lords. The Tyrolese peasants, under their wise leader,
            Michael Gaismeyer, shut up Archduke Ferdinand in Innsbruck, and
            in the end gained substantial concessions. The rising in Styria
            was a very strong one; it lasted till 1526, and was eventually
            put down by bringing Bohemian troops into the country. From
            Swabia the flames of insurrection spread into Franconia, where a
            portion of the insurgents were led by an escaped criminal, the
            notorious Jäklein Rohrbach. It was this band which perpetrated
            the wanton massacre of Weinsberg, the one outstanding atrocity of
            the insurrection. The band and the deed were repudiated by the
            rest of the insurgents. Thomas Münzer, who, banished from Zwickau
            and then from Alstedt, had settled in Mühlhausen, his heart
            aflame with the wrongs of the commonalty, preached insurrection
            to the peasants in Thüringen. He issued fiery proclamations:</p>

            meant to rouse the miners of Mansfeld. They failed in their
            original intention, but they sent bands of armed insurgents
            through Thüringen and the Harz, and within fourteen days about
            forty convents and monasteries were destroyed, and the inmates
            (many of them poor women with no homes to return to) were sent
            adrift.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The revolt
            spread like a conflagration, one province catching fire from
            another, until in the early spring months of 1525 almost all
            Germany was in uproar. The only districts which escaped were
            Bavaria in the south, Hesse, and the north and north-east
            provinces. The insurgents were not peasants only. The poorer
            population of many of the towns fraternised with the insurgents,
            and compelled the civic authorities to admit them within their
            walls.</p>

            Articles.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Statements of
            grievances were published which, naturally, bore a strong
            resemblance to those issued in the earlier social uprisings. The
            countrymen complained of the continuous appropriation of the
            woodlands by the proprietors, and that they were not allowed to
            fish in the streams or to kill game in their fields. They
            denounced the proprietors' practice of compelling his peasants to
            do all manner of unstipulated service for him without payment—to
            repair his roads, to assist at his hunts, to draw his fish-ponds.
            They said that their crops were ruined by game which they were
            not allowed to kill, and by hunters in pursuit of game; that the
            landlord led his streams across their meadow land, and deprived
            them of water for irrigation. They protested against arbitrary
            punishments, unknown to the old consuetudinary village law-courts
            (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They
            formulated their demands for justice in various series of
            articles, all of which had common features, but contained some
            striking differences. Some dwelt more on the grievances of the
            peasants, others voiced the demands of the working classes of the
            towns, others again contained <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            "tei tei-anchor"></a> traces of the political aspirations of the
            more educated leaders of the movement. Almost all protest that
            they ask for nothing contrary to the requirements of just
            authority, whether civil or ecclesiastical, nor to the gospel of
            Christ. The peasants declared that each village community should
            be at liberty to choose its own pastor, and to dismiss him if he
            proved to be unsatisfactory; that while they were willing to pay
            the great tithes (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> a tenth of the produce of
            the crops), the lesser tithes (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
            a tenth of the eggs, lambs, foals, etc.) should no longer be
            exacted; that these great tithes should be reserved to pay the
            village priest's stipend, and that what remained over should go
            to support the poor; that, since God had made all men free,
            serfdom should be abolished; and that, while they were willing to
            obey lawful authority, peasants ought not to be called on to
            submit to the arbitrary commands of their landlords. They
            insisted that they had a right to fish in the streams (not in
            fish-ponds), to kill game and wild birds, for these were public
            property. They demanded that the woodlands, meadows, and
            ploughlands which had once belonged to the village community, but
            which had been appropriated by the landlords, should be restored.
            They insisted that arbitrary services of every kind should be
            abolished, and that whatever services, beyond the old feudal
            dues, were demanded, should be paid for in wages. They called for
            the abolition of the usage whereby the landlord was permitted, in
            the name of death-duty, to seize on the most valuable chattel of
            the deceased tenant; and for the creation of impartial courts of
            justice in the country districts. They concluded by asking that
            all their demands should be tested by the word of God, and that
            if any of them should be found to be opposed to its teaching, it
            should be rejected.<a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            townspeople asked that all class privileges should be abolished
            in civic and ecclesiastical appointments; that <span class=

            "Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the administration of justice
            in the town's courts should be improved; that the local taxation
            should be readjusted; that all the inhabitants should be
            permitted to vote for the election of the councillors; and that
            better provision should be made for the care of the poor. Some of
            the more ambitious manifestoes contained demands for a thorough
            reconstruction of the entire administration of the Empire, on a
            scheme which involved the overthrow of all feudal courts of
            justice, and contemplated a series of imperial judicatories,
            rising from revived Communal Courts to a central Imperial Court
            of Appeal for the whole Empire. Some manifestoes demanded a
            unification of the coinage, weights, and measures throughout the
            Empire; a confiscation of ecclesiastical endowments for the
            purpose of lessening taxation, and for the redemption of feudal
            dues; a uniform rate of taxes and customs duties; restraint to be
            placed on the operations of the great capitalists; the regulation
            of commerce and trade by law; and the admission of
            representatives from all classes in the community into the public
            administration. In every case the Emperor was regarded as the
            Lord Paramount. There were also declarations of the sovereignty
            of the people, made in such a way as to suggest that the writings
            of Marsilius of Padua had been studied by some of the leaders
            among the insurgents. The most famous of all these declarations
            was the Twelve Articles. The document was adopted by delegates
            from several of the insurrectionary bands, which met at Memmingen
            in Upper Swabia, to unite upon a common basis of action. If not
            actually drafted by Schappeler, a friend of Zwingli, the articles
            were probably inspired by him. These Twelve Articles gave
            something like unity to the movement; although it must be
            remembered that documents bearing the title do not always agree.
            The main thought with the peasant was to secure a fair share of
            the land, security of tenure, and diminution of feudal
            servitudes; and the idea of the artisan was to obtain full civic
            privileges and an adequate representation of his class on the
            city council.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the
            earlier months of 1525 the rising carried everything before it.
            Many of the smaller towns made common cause with the peasants;
            indeed, it was feared that all the towns of Swabia might unite in
            supporting the movement. Prominent nobles were forced to join the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Evangelical Brotherhood”</span> which
            had been formally constituted at Memmingen (March 7th). Princes,
            like the Cardinal Elector of Mainz and the Bishop of Würzburg,
            had to come to terms with the insurgents. Germany had been
            denuded of soldiers, drafted to take part in the Italian wars of
            Charles <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">v.</span></span> The ruling powers
            engaged the insurgents in negotiations simply for the purpose of
            gaining time, as was afterwards seen. But the rising had no
            solidity in it, nor did it produce, save in the Tyrol, any leader
            capable of effectually controlling his followers and of giving
            practical result to their efforts. The insurgents became
            demoralised after their first successes, and the whole movement
            had begun to show signs of dissolution before the princes had
            recovered from their terror. Philip of Hesse aided the Elector of
            Saxony (John, for Frederick had died during the insurrection) to
            crush Münzer at Frankenhausen (May 15th, 1525), the town of
            Mühlhausen was taken, and deprived of its privileges as an
            imperial city, and the revolt was crushed in North Germany.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">George
            Truchsess, the general of the Swabian League, his army
            strengthened by mercenaries returning to Germany after the battle
            of Pavia, mastered the bands in Swabia and in Franconia. The
            Elsass revolt was suppressed with great ferocity by Duke Anthony
            of Lorraine. None of the German princes showed any consideration
            or mercy to their revolting subjects save the old Elector
            Frederick and Philip of Hesse. The former, on his death-bed,
            besought his brother to deal leniently with the misguided people;
            Philip's peasantry had fewer matters to complain of than had
            those of any other province, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            "tei tei-anchor"></a> the Landgrave discussed their grievances
            with them, and made concessions which effectually prevented any
            revolt. Everywhere else, save in the Tyrol, the revolt was
            crushed with merciless severity, and between 100,000 and 150,000
            of the insurgents perished on the field or elsewhere. The
            insurrection maintained itself in the Tyrol, in Salzburg, and in
            Styria until the spring of 1526; in all other districts of
            Germany the insurgents were crushed before the close of 1525. No
            attempt was made to cure the ills which led to the rising. The
            oppression of the peasantry was intensified. The last vestiges of
            local self-government were destroyed, and the unfortunate people
            were doomed for generations to exist in the lowest degradation.
            The year 1525 was one of the saddest in the annals of the German
            Fatherland.</p>

            which he conspicuously led. It checked the spread of the
            Reformation throughout the whole of Germany. It threw the
            guidance of the movement into the hands of the evangelical
            princes, and destroyed the hope that it might give birth to a

            War.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The effect of
            the rising upon Luther's own character and future conduct was too
            important for us to entirely pass over his personal relations to
            the peasants and their revolt. He was a peasant's son.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“My father, my grandfather, my forebears,
            were all genuine peasants,”</span> he was accustomed to say. He
            had seen and pitied the oppression of the peasant class, and had
            denounced it in his own trenchant fashion. He had reproved the
            greed of the landlords, when he said that if the peasant's land
            produced as many coins as ears of corn, the profit would go to
            the landlord only. He had publicly expressed his approval of
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name=
            "Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> many of the
            proposals in the Twelve Articles long before they had been
            formulated and adopted at Memmingen in March 1525, and had
            advocated a return to the old communal laws or usages of Germany.
            He formally declared his agreement with the substance of the
            Twelve Articles after they had become the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“charter”</span> of the revolt. But Luther, rightly
            or wrongly, held that no real good could come from armed
            insurrection. He believed with all the tenacity of his nature,
            that while there might be two roads to reform, the way of peace,
            and the way of war, the pathway of peace was the only one which
            would lead to lasting benefit. After the storm burst he risked
            his life over and over again in visits he paid to the disaffected
            districts, to warn the people of the dangers they were running.
            After Münzer's attempt to rouse the miners of Mansfeld, and carry
            fire and sword into the district where his parents were living,
            Luther made one last attempt to bring the misguided people to a
            more reasonable course. He made a preaching tour through the
            disaffected districts. He went west from Eisleben to Stolberg
            (April 21st, 1525); thence to Nordhausen, where Münzer's
            sympathisers rang the bells to drown his voice; south to Erfurt
            (April 28th); north again to the fertile valley of the Golden Aue
            and to Wallhausen (May 1st); south again to Weimar (May 3rd),
            where news reached him that his Elector was dying, and that he
            had expressed the wish to see him,—a message which reached him
            too late. It was on this journey, or shortly after his return to
            Wittenberg (May 6th), that Luther wrote his vehement tract,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Against
            the murdering, thieving hordes of Peasants</span></span>. He
            wrote it while his mind was full of Münzer's calls to slaughter,
            when the danger was at its height, with all the sights and sounds
            of destruction and turmoil in eye and ear, while it still hung in
            the balance whether the insurgent bands might not carry all
            before them. In this terrible pamphlet Luther hounded on the
            princes to crush the rising. It is this pamphlet, all extenuating
            circumstances being taken into account, which must <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As for
            himself, the Peasants' War imprinted in him a deep distrust of
            all who had any connection with the rising. He had not forgotten
            Carlstadt's action at Wittenberg in 1521-1522, and when Carlstadt
            was found attempting to preach the insurrection in Franconia and
            Swabia, Luther never forgave him. His deep-rooted and
            unquenchable suspicion of Zwingli may be traced back to his
            discovery that friends of the Zurich Reformer had been at
            Memmingen, had aided the revolutionary delegates to draft the
            Twelve Articles, and had induced them to shelter themselves under
            the shield of a religious Reformation. What is perhaps more
            important, the Peasants' War gave to Luther a deep and abiding
            distrust of the <span class="tei tei-q">“common man”</span> which
            was altogether lacking in the earlier stages of his career, which
            made him prevent every effort to give anything like a democratic
            ecclesiastical organisation to the Evangelical Church, and which
            led him to bind his Reformation in the chains of secular control
            to the extent of regarding the secular authority as possessing a
            quasi-episcopal function.<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325"
            href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a> It
            is probably true that he saved the Reformation in Germany by
            cutting it loose from the revolutionary movement; but the wrench
            left marks on his own character as well as on that of the
            movement he headed. Luther's enemies were quick to make capital
            out of his relations with the peasants, and Einser compared him
            to Pilate, who washed his hands after betraying Jesus to the
            Jews.</p>

            Luther, had a profound influence on the whole of the German
            Reformation. Some princes who had hitherto favoured the Romanist
            side were confirmed in their opposition; others who had
            hesitated, definitely abandoned the cause of Reform. For both, it
            seemed that a social revolution of a desperate kind lay behind
            the Protestant Reformation. Many an innocent preacher of the new
            faith perished in the disturbances—sought out and slain by the
            princes as an instigator of the rebellion. Duke Anthony of
            Lorraine, for example, in his suppression of the revolt in
            Elsass, made no concealment of his belief that evangelical
            preachers were the cause of the rising, and butchered them
            without mercy when he could discover them. The Curia found that
            the Peasants' War was an admirable text to preach from when they
            insisted that Luther was another Huss, and that the movement
            which he led was a revival of the ecclesiastical and social
            communism of the extreme Hussites (Taborites); that all who
            attacked the Church of Rome were engaged in attempting to destroy
            the bases of society. It was after the Peasants' War that the
            Roman Catholic League of princes grew strong in numbers and in
            cohesion.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The result of
            the war also showed that the one strong political element in
            Germany was the princedom. The <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span>, which still
            preserved a precarious existence, had shown that it had no power
            to cope with the disturbances, and its attempts at mediation had
            been treated with contempt. From this year, 1525, the political
            destiny of the land was distinctly seen to be definitely shaping
            for territorial centralisation round the greater princes and
            nobles. It was inevitable that the conservative religious
            Reformation should follow the lines of political growth, with the
            result that there could not be a National Evangelical Church of
            Germany. It could only find outcome in territorial Churches under
            the rule and protection of those princes who from motives of
            religion <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg
            339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            and conscience had adopted the principles which Luther
            preached.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The more
            radical religious movement broke up into fragments, and
            reappeared in the guise of the maligned and persecuted
            Anabaptists,—a name which embraced a very wide variety of
            religious opinions,—some of whom appropriated to themselves the
            aspirations of the social revolution which had been crushed by
            the princes. The conservative and Lutheran Reformation found its
            main elements of strength in the middle classes of Germany; while
            the Anabaptists had their largest following among the artisans
            and working men of the towns.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The terrors of
            the time separated Germany into two hostile camps—the one
            accepting and the other rejecting the ecclesiastical Reformation,
            which ceased to be a national movement in any real sense of the
            word.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Germany
            emerged from the social revolution in the end of 1525, it soon
            became apparent that the religious question remained unsettled,
            and was dividing the country into two parties whose differences
            had become visibly accentuated, and that both held as strongly as
            ever to their distinctive principles. Perhaps one of the reasons
            for the increased strain was the conduct of many of the Romanist
            princes in suppressing the rebellion. The victories of the
            Swabian League in South Germany were everywhere followed by
            religious persecution. Men were condemned to confiscation of
            goods or to death, not for rebellion, for they had never taken
            part in the rising, but for their confessed attachment to
            Lutheran teaching. The Lutheran preachers were special objects of
            attack. Aichili, who acted as a provost-marshal to the Swabian
            League, made himself conspicuous by plundering, mulcting, and
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name=
            "Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> putting them to
            death. It is said that he hung forty Lutheran pastors on the
            trees by the roadside in one small district. The Roman Catholic
            princes had banded themselves together for mutual defence as
            early as July 1525. The more influential members of this league
            were Duke George of Saxony, the Electors of Brandenburg and
            Mainz, and Duke Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Duke Henry was
            selected to inform the Emperor of what they had done, and to
            secure his sympathy and support. He told Charles <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">v.</span></span> that the league had
            been formed <span class="tei tei-q">“against the Lutherans in
            case they should attempt by force or cunning to gain them over to
            their unbelief.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
            hand, the Protestant princes had a mutual understanding—it does
            not seem to have been a definite league—to defend one another
            against any attack upon their faith. The leaders were John of
            Saxony, Philip of Hesse, Dukes Otto, Ernest, and Francis of
            Brunswick-Lüneberg, and the Counts of Mansfeld. Philip of Hesse
            was the soul of the union. They could count on the support of
            many of the imperial cities, some of them, such as Nürnberg,
            being in districts where the country lying around was ruled by
            Romanist princes.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Diet,
            which met at Augsburg in 1525, was very thinly attended, and both
            parties waited for the Diet which was to be held at Speyer in the
            following year.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There never
            had been any doubt about the position and opinions of the Emperor
            on the religious question. He had stated them emphatically at the
            Diet of Worms. He had been educated in the beliefs of mediæval
            Catholicism: he valued the ceremonies and usages of the mediæval
            worship; he understood no other ecclesiastical polity; he
            believed that the Bishop of Rome was the head of the Church on
            earth; he had consistently persecuted Protestants in his
            hereditary dominions from the beginning; he desired the execution
            of the Edict of Worms against Luther. If he had remained in
            Germany, all his personal and official influence would have been
            thrown into the scale against the evangelical faith. Troubles in
            Spain, and the prosecution <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page342">[pg 342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the war against Francis of France had
            prevented his presence in Germany after his first brief visit. He
            had now conquered and taken Francis prisoner at the battle of
            Pavia. The terms of the Treaty of Madrid bound Francis to assist
            Charles in suppressing Lutheranism and other pernicious sects in
            Germany, and when it was signed the Emperor seemed free to crush
            the German Protestants. But his very success was against him;
            papal diplomacy wove another web around him; he was still unable
            to visit the Fatherland, and the religious question had to be
            discussed at Speyer in his absence.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the Diet
            met, the national hostility to Rome showed no signs of abatement.
            The subject of German grievances against the Curia was again
            revived, and it was alleged that the chief causes of the
            Peasants' War were the merciless exactions of clerical
            landholders. Perhaps this opinion was justified by the fact that
            the condition of the peasantry on the lands of monasteries and of
            bishops was notoriously worse than that of those under secular
            proprietors; and that, while the clerical landholders had done
            little to subdue the rebels, they had been merciless after the
            insurgents had been subdued. There was truth enough in the charge
            to make it a sufficient answer to the accusation that the social
            revolution had been the outcome of Luther's teaching.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ferdinand of
            Austria presided in his brother's absence, and, acting on the
            Emperor's instructions, he demanded the enforcement of the Edict
            of Worms and a decree of the Diet to forbid all innovations in
            worship and in doctrine. He promised that if these imperial
            demands were granted, the Emperor would induce the Pope to call a
            General Council for the definite settlement of the religious
            difficulties. But the Diet was not inclined to adopt the
            suggestions. The Emperor was at war with the Pope. Many of the
            clerical members felt themselves to be in a delicate position,
            and did not attend. The Lutheran sympathisers were in a majority,
            and the delegates from the cities insisted that it was impossible
            to enforce the Edict <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg
            343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            of Worms. The Committee of Princes<a id="noteref_327" name=
            "noteref_327" href="#note_327"><span class=

            proposed to settle the religious question by a compromise which
            was almost wholly favourable to the Reformation. They suggested
            that the marriage of priests, giving the cup to the laity, the
            use of German as well as Latin in the baptismal and communion
            services, should be recognised; that all private Masses should be
            abolished; that the number of ecclesiastical holy days should be
            largely reduced; and that in the exposition of Holy Writ the rule
            ought to be that scripture should be interpreted by scripture.
            After a good deal of fencing, the Diet finally resolved on a
            deliverance which provided that the word of God should be
            preached without disturbance, that indemnity should be granted
            for past offences against the Edict of Worms, and that, until the
            meeting of a General Council to be held in a German city, each
            State should so live as it hoped to answer for its conduct to God
            and to the Emperor.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The decision
            was a triumph for the territorial system as well as for the
            Reformation, and foreshadowed the permanent religious peace of
            Augsburg (1555). It is difficult to see how either Charles or
            Ferdinand could have accepted it. Their acquiescence was probably
            due to the fact that the Emperor was then at war with the Pope
            (the sack of Rome under the Constable Bourbon took place on May
            6th, 1527), and that the threat of a German ecclesiastical revolt
            was a good weapon to use against His Holiness. Ferdinand was
            negotiating for election to the crowns of Hungary and Bohemia,
            and dared not offend his German subjects. Both brothers looked on
            any concessions to the German Lutherans as temporary compromises
            to be withdrawn as soon as they were able to enforce their own
            views.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Protestant
            States and cities at once interpreted this decision of the Diet
            to mean that they had the legal right to organise territorial
            Churches and to introduce such <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> changes into public worship as would bring
            it into harmony with their evangelical beliefs.<a id=
            "noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href="#note_328"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a> The
            latent evangelical feeling at once manifested itself. Almost all
            North Germany, except Brandenburg, Ducal Saxony, and
            Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, became Lutheran within three years. Still
            it has to be noticed that the legal recognition was accorded to
            the secular authorities, and that a ruling prince, who had no
            very settled religious convictions, might change the religion of
            his principality from political or selfish motives. It became
            evident in 1529 that political feeling or fear of the Emperor was
            much stronger than resolutions to support the evangelical
            Reformation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon after the
            Diet, Philip of Hesse committed a political blunder which, in the
            opinion of many of his evangelical friends, involved disloyalty
            to the Fatherland, made them chary of associating themselves with
            him, and greatly weakened the Protestant party. For most of these
            North German princes, in spite of their clinging to the
            disruptive territorial principle, had a rugged conscientious
            patriotism which made them feel that no good German should seek
            the aid of France or make alliance with a Czech. Many of the
            Roman Catholic princes, irritated at the spread and organisation
            of Lutheranism which followed the decision of the Diet of 1526,
            had been persecuting by confiscation of goods and by death their
            Lutheran subjects. The Landgrave had married the daughter of Duke
            George of Saxony, and he knew that his father-in-law was
            continually uttering threats against the Elector of Saxony.
            Brooding over these things, Philip became gradually convinced
            that the Romanist princes were planning a deadly assault on the
            Lutherans, and that first the Elector and then he himself would
            be attacked and their territories partitioned among the
            conquerors. He had no proof, but his suspicions were strong.
            Chance brought him in contact with Otto von Pack, the steward of
            the Chancery of Ducal Saxony, who, on being questioned, admitted
            that the suspicions <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg
            345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            of Philip were correct, and promised to procure a copy of the
            treaty. Pack was a scoundrel. No such treaty existed. He forged a
            document which he declared to be a copy of a genuine treaty, and
            got 4000 gulden for his pains. Philip took the forgery to the
            Elector of Saxony and to Luther, both of whom had no doubt of its
            genuine character. They both, however, refused to agree to
            Philip's plan of seeking assistance outside the Empire. The
            Landgrave believed the situation too dangerous to be faced
            passively. He tried to secure the assistance of Francis of France
            and of Zapolya, the determined opponent of the House of Austria
            in Bohemia. It was not until he had fully committed himself that
            the discovery was made that the document he had trusted in was
            nothing but a forgery. His hasty action in appealing to France
            and Bohemia to interfere in the domestic concerns of the Empire
            was resented by his co-religionists. When the Diet met at Speyer,
            the Lutherans were divided and discredited. On the other hand,
            the Pope and the Emperor were no longer at war, and the clerical
            members flocked to the Diet in large numbers.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this
            memorable Diet of Speyer (1529), a compact Roman Catholic
            majority faced a weak Lutheran minority. The Emperor, through his
            commissioners, declared at the outset that he abolished,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“by his imperial and absolute authority
            (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Machtvollkommenheit</span></span>),”</span>
            the clause in the ordinance of 1526 on which the Lutherans had
            relied when they founded their territorial Churches; it had been
            the cause, he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“of much ill counsel
            and misunderstanding.”</span> The majority of the Diet upheld the
            Emperor's decision, and the practical effect of the ordinance
            which was voted was to rescind that of 1526. It declared that the
            German States which had accepted the Edict of Worms should
            continue to do so; which meant that there was to be no toleration
            for Lutherans in Romanist districts. It said that in districts
            which had departed from the Edict no further innovations were to
            be made, save that no one was to be prevented from hearing Mass;
            that sects which denied the sacrament <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the true Body and Blood of Christ
            (Zwinglians) should no more be tolerated than Anabaptists. What
            was most important, it declared that no ecclesiastical body
            should be deprived of its authority or revenues. It was this last
            clause which destroyed all possibility of creating Lutheran
            Churches; for it meant that the mediæval ecclesiastical rule was
            everywhere to be restored, and with it the right of bishops to
            deal with all preachers within their dioceses.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was this
            ordinance which called forth the celebrated <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">Protest</span></span>, from which
            comes the name <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Protestant</span></span>. The Protest was
            read in the Diet on the day (April 19th, 1529) when all
            concessions to the Lutherans had been refused. Ferdinand and the
            other imperial commissioners would not permit its publication in
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“recess,”</span> and the protesters
            had a legal instrument drafted and published, in which they
            embodied the Protest, with all the necessary documents annexed.
            The legal position taken was that the unanimous decision of one
            Diet (1526) could not be rescinded by a majority in a second Diet
            (1529). The Protesters declared that they meant to abide by the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“recess”</span> of 1526; that the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“recess”</span> of 1529 was not to be
            held binding on them, because they were not consenting parties.
            When forced to make their choice between obedience to God and
            obedience to the Emperor, they were compelled to choose the
            former; and they appealed, from the wrongs done to them at the
            Diet, to the Emperor, to the next free General Council of Holy
            Christendom, or to an ecclesiastical congress of the German
            nation. The document was signed by the Elector John of Saxony,
            Margrave George of Brandenburg, Dukes Ernest and Francis of
            Brunswick-Lüneburg, Landgrave Philip of Hesse, and Prince
            Wolfgang of Anhalt. The fourteen cities which adhered were
            Strassburg, Nürnberg, Ulm, Constance, Lindau, Memmingen,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name=
            "Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Kempten,
            Nördlingen, Heilbronn, Reutlingen, Isny, St. Gallen, Wissenberg,
            and Windsheim. Many of these cities were Zwinglian rather than
            Lutheran; but all united in face of the common danger.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Protest at
            Speyer embodied the principle, not a new one, that a minority of
            German States, when they felt themselves oppressed by a majority,
            could entrench themselves behind the laws of the Empire; and the
            idea is seen at work onward to the Diet of 1555, when it was
            definitely recognised. Such a minority, to maintain a successful
            defence, had to be united and able to protect itself by force if
            necessary. This was at once felt; and three days after the
            Protest had been read in the Diet (April, 22nd), Electoral
            Saxony, Hesse, and the cities of Strassburg, Ulm, and Nürnberg
            had concluded a <span class="tei tei-q">“secret and particular
            treaty.”</span> They pledged themselves to mutual defence if
            attacked on account of God's word, whether the onslaught came
            from the Swabian League, from the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichsregiment</span></span>, or from the
            Emperor himself. Soon after the Diet, proposals were brought
            forward to make the compact effective and extensive,—one drafted
            by representatives of the cities and the other by the Elector of
            Saxony,—which provided very thoroughly for mutual support; but
            neither took into account the differences which lay behind the
            Protest. These divergences were strong enough to wreck the
            union.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            differences which separated the German Protestants were not
            wholly theological, although their doctrinal disputes were most
            in evidence.</p>

            Zwingli.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A movement for
            reformation, which owed little or nothing to Wittenberg, had been
            making rapid progress in Switzerland, and two of the strongest
            cantons, Zurich and Bern, had revolted from the Roman Church. Its
            leader, Huldreich Zwingli, was utterly unlike Luther in
            temperament, training, and environment.</p><span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id=
            "Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had never
            gone through the terrible spiritual conflicts which had marked
            Luther for life, and had made him the man that he was. No deep
            sense of personal sin had ever haunted him, to make his early
            manhood a burden to him. Long after he had become known as a
            Reformer, he was able to combine a strong sense of moral
            responsibility with some laxity in private life. Unlike both
            Luther and Calvin, he was not the type of man to be leader in a
            deeply spiritual revival.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had been
            subjected to the influences of Humanism from his childhood. His
            uncle, Bartholomew Zwingli, parish priest at Wildhaus, and the
            dean of Wesen, under whose charge the boy was placed, had a
            strong sympathy for the New Learning, and the boy imbibed it. His
            young intellect was fed on Homer and Pindar and Cicero; and all
            his life he esteemed the great pagans of antiquity as highly as
            he did any Christian saint. If it can be said that he bent before
            the dominating influence of any one man, it was Erasmus and not
            Luther who compelled him to admiration. He had for a teacher
            Thomas Wyttenbach, who was half Reformer and half disciple of
            Erasmus; and learned from him to study the Scriptures and the
            writings of such earlier Church Fathers as Origen, Jerome, and
            Chrysostom. Like many another Humanist north of the Alps, the
            mystical Christian Platonism of Pico della Mirandola had some
            influence on him. He had never studied the Scholastic Theology,
            and knew nothing of the spell it cast over men who had been
            trained in it. Of all the Reformers, Luther was the least removed
            from the mediæval way of looking at religion, and Zwingli had
            wandered farthest from it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His earliest
            ecclesiastical surroundings were also different from Luther's. He
            had never been taught in childhood to consider the Church to be
            the Pope's House, in which the Bishop of Rome was entitled to the
            reverence and obedience due to the house-father. In his land the
            people had been long accustomed to manage their own
            ecclesiastical affairs. The greater portion of Switzerland had
            known but little <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg
            349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            either of the benefits or disadvantages of mediæval episcopal
            rule. Church property paid its share of the communal taxes, and
            even the monasteries and convents were liable to civil
            inspection. If a stray tourist at the present day wanders into
            the church which is called the Cathedral in that survival of
            ancient mediæval republics, San Marino, he will find that the
            seats of the <span class="tei tei-q">“consuls”</span> of the
            little republic occupy the place where he expects to find the
            bishop's chair. The civil power asserted its supremacy over the
            ecclesiastical in most things in these small mediæval republics.
            The Popes needed San Marino to be a thorn in the side of the
            Malatesta of Rimini, they hired most of their soldiers from the
            Swiss cantons, and therefore tolerated many things which they
            would not have permitted elsewhere.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The social
            environment of the Swiss Reformer was very different from that of
            Luther. He was a free Swiss who had listened in childhood to
            tales of the heroic fights of Morgarten, Sempach, Morat, and
            Nancy, and had imbibed the hereditary hatred of the House of
            Hapsburg. He had no fear of the <span class="tei tei-q">“common
            man,”</span> Luther's bugbear after the Peasants' War. Orderly
            democratic life was the air he breathed, and what reverence
            Luther had for the Emperor <span class="tei tei-q">“who protected
            poor people against the Turk,”</span> and for the lords of the
            soil, Zwingli paid to the civic fathers elected by a popular
            vote. When the German Reformer thought of Zwingli he was always
            muttering what Archbishop Parker said of John Knox—<span class=
            "tei tei-q">“God keep us from such visitations as Knockes hath
            attempted in Scotland; the people to be orderers of
            things!”</span><a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href=
            "#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Owing
            doubtless to this republican training, Zwingli had none of that
            aloofness from political affairs which was a marked
            characteristic of Luther. He believed that his mission had as
            much to do with politics as with religion, and that religious
            reformation was to be worked out by political forces, whether in
            the more limited sphere of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Switzerland or in larger Germany. He had
            never taken a step forward until he had carried along with him
            the civic authorities of Zurich. His advance had always been
            calculated. Luther's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span> (November 1517) had
            been the volcanic outburst of a conscience troubled by the sight
            of a great religious scandal, and their author had no intention
            of doing more than protesting against the one great evil; he had
            no idea at the time where his protest was leading him. Zwingli's
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theses</span></span> (January 1523) were the
            carefully drafted programme of a Reformation which he meant to
            accomplish by degrees, and through the assistance of the Council
            of Zurich. His mind was full of political combinations for the
            purpose of carrying out his plans of reformation. As early as
            1524 he was in correspondence with Pirkheimer about the
            possibility of a league between Nürnberg and Zurich—two powerful
            Protestant towns. This league did not take shape. But in 1527 a
            religious and political league (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">das christliche
            Bürgerrecht</span></span>) was concluded between Zurich and
            Constance, an imperial German town; St. Gallen joined in 1528;
            Biel, Mühlhausen, and Basel in 1529; even Strassburg, afraid of
            the growing power of the House of Hapsburg, was included in 1530.
            The feverish political activity of Zwingli commended him to
            Philip of Hesse almost as strongly as it made him disliked, and
            even feared, by Ferdinand of Austria. The Elector of Saxony and
            Luther dreaded his influence over <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            young man of Hesse.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Melanchthon
            was the first to insist on the evil influences of Zwingli's
            activity for the peace of the Empire. He persuaded himself that
            had the Lutherans stood alone at Speyer, the Romanists would have
            been prepared to make concessions which would have made the
            Protest needless. He returned to Wittenberg full of misgivings.
            The Protest might lead to a defiance of the Emperor, and to a
            subversion of the Empire. Was it right for subjects to defend
            themselves by war against the civil power which was ordained of
            God? <span class="tei tei-q">“My conscience,”</span> he wrote,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“is disquieted because of this thing; I
            am half dead with thinking about it.”</span></p><span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id=
            "Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He found
            Luther only too sympathetic; resolute to maintain that if the
            prince commanded anything which was contrary to the word of God,
            it was the duty of the subject to offer what passive resistance
            he was able, but that it was never right to oppose him actively
            by force of arms. Still less was it the duty of a Christian man
            to ally himself for such resistance with those who did not hold
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the whole truth of God.”</span> Luther
            would therefore have nothing to do with an alliance offensive and
            defensive against the Emperor with cities who shared in what he
            believed to be the errors of Zwingli.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This meant a
            great deal more than a break with the Swiss. The south German
            towns of Strassburg, Memmingen, Constance, Lindau, and others
            were more Zwinglian than Lutheran. It was not only that they were
            inclined to the more radical theology of the Swiss Reformer; they
            found that his method of organising a reformed Church, drafted
            for the needs of Zurich, suited their municipal institutions
            better than the territorial organisations being adopted by the
            Lutheran Churches of North Germany. To Luther, whose views of the
            place of the <span class="tei tei-q">“common man”</span> in the
            Church had been changed by the Peasants' War, this was of itself
            a danger which threatened the welfare of the infant Churches. It
            made ecclesiastical government too democratic; and it did this in
            the very centres where the democracy was most dangerous. He could
            not forget that the mob of these German towns had taken part in
            the recently suppressed social revolution, that their
            working-class population was still the recruiting ground of the
            Anabaptist sectaries, and that at Memmingen itself Zwinglian
            partisans had helped to organise the revolution, and to link it
            on to the religious awakening. Besides, the attraction which drew
            these German cities to the Swiss might lead to larger political
            consequences which seemed to threaten what unity remained to the
            German Empire. It might result in the detachment of towns from
            the German Fatherland, and in the formation of new cantons cut
            adrift from Germany to increase the strength of the Swiss
            Confederation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these
            thoughts were in the minds of Luther and of his fellow
            theologians, and had their weight with the Elector of Saxony,
            when their refusal to join rendered the proposed defensive league
            impossible. No one was more disappointed than the Landgrave of
            Hesse, the ablest political leader whom the German Reformation
            produced. He knew more about Zwingli than his fellow princes in
            North Germany; he had a keen interest in theological questions;
            he sympathised to some extent with the special opinions of
            Zwingli; and he had not the dread of democracy which possessed
            Luther and his Elector. He believed, rightly as events showed,
            that differences or suspected differences in theology were the
            strongest causes of separation; he was correct in supposing that
            the Lutheran divines through ignorance magnified those points of
            difference; and he hoped that if the Lutherans and the Swiss
            could be brought together, they would learn to know each other
            better. So he tried to arrange for a religious conference in his
            castle at Marburg. He had many a difficulty to overcome so far as
            the Lutherans were concerned. Neither Luther nor Melanchthon
            desired to meet Zwingli. Melanchthon thought that if a conference
            was to be held, it would be much better to meet Oecolampadius and
            perhaps some learned Romanists. Zwingli, on the other hand, was
            eager to meet Luther. He responded at once. <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id=
            "Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> He came, without waiting for
            leave to be given by the Zurich Council, across a country full of
            enemies. The conference met from October 30th to November 5th,
            1529. Luther was accompanied by Melanchthon, Justus Jonas, and
            Cruciger, Frederick Mecum from Gotha, Osiander from Nürnberg,
            Brenz from Hall, Stephan Agricola from Augsburg, and others. With
            Zwingli came Oecolampadius, Bucer, and Hedio from Strassburg,
            Rudolph Collin (who has left the fullest account of the
            discussion), two councillors from Basel and from Zurich, and
            Jacob Sturm from Strassburg. After a preliminary conference
            between Zwingli and Melanchthon on the one hand, and Luther and
            Oecolampadius on the other, the real discussion took place in the
            great hall of the Castle. The tourist is still shown the exact
            spot where the table which separated the disputants was
            placed.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Marburg
            Colloquy</span></span>, as the conference was called, had
            important results for good, although it was unsuccessful in
            fulfilling the expectations of the Landgrave. It showed a real
            and substantial harmony between the two sets of theologians on
            all points save one. Fifteen theological articles (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Marburg
            Articles</span></span>) stated the chief heads of the Christian
            faith, and fourteen were signed by Luther and by Zwingli. The one
            subject on which they could not come to an agreement was the
            relation of the Body of Christ to the elements Bread and Wine in
            the Sacrament of the Supper. It was scarcely to be expected that
            there could be harmony on a doctrinal matter on which there had
            been such a long and embittered controversy.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both
            theologians found in the mediæval doctrine of the Sacrament of
            the Supper what they believed to be an overwhelming error
            destructive to the spiritual life. It presupposed that a priest,
            in virtue of mysterious powers conferred in ordination, could
            give or withhold from the Christian people the benefits conveyed
            in the Sacrament. It asserted that the priest could change the
            elements Bread and Wine into the very Body and Blood of Christ,
            and that unless this change was made there was no presence
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name=
            "Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Christ in the
            sacrament, and no possibility of sacramental grace for the
            communicant. Luther attacked the problem as a mediæval Christian,
            content, if he was able to purge the ordinance of this one fault,
            to leave all else as he found it. Zwingli came as a Humanist,
            whose fundamental rule was to get beyond the mediæval theology
            altogether, and attempt to discover how the earlier Church
            Fathers could aid him to solve the problem. This difference in
            mental attitude led them to approach the subject from separate
            sides; and the mediæval way of looking at the whole subject
            rendered difference of approach very easy. The mediæval Church
            had divided the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper into two distinct
            parts—the Mass and the Eucharist.<a id="noteref_332" name=
            "noteref_332" href="#note_332"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a> The
            Mass was inseparably connected with the thought of the great
            Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross, and the Eucharist with the
            thought of the believer's communion with the Risen Living Christ.
            Zwingli attacked the Romanist doctrine of the Mass, and Luther
            sought to give an evangelical meaning to the mediæval conception
            of the Eucharist. Hence the two Protestant antagonists were never
            exactly facing each other.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther's
            convent studies in D'Ailly, Biel, and their common master,
            William of Occam, enabled him to show that there might be the
            presence of the Glorified Body of Christ, extended in space, in
            the elements Bread and Wine in a natural way, and without any
            priestly miracle: and that satisfied him; it enabled him to deny
            the priestly miracle and keep true in the most literal way to the
            words of the institution, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is My
            Body.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Zwingli, on
            the other hand, insisted that the primary reference in the Lord's
            Supper was to the death of Christ, and that it was above all
            things a commemorative rite. He transformed the mediæval Mass
            into an evangelical sacrament, by placing the idea of
            commemoration where the mediæval theologian had put that of
            repetition, and held that the means of appropriation was faith
            and not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg
            355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            eating with the mouth. This he held to be a return to the belief
            of the early centuries, before the conception of the sacrament
            had been corrupted by pagan ideas.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like Luther,
            he served himself heir to the work of earlier theologians; but he
            did not go to Occam, Biel, or D'Ailly, as the German Reformer had
            done. Erasmus, who had no liking for the priestly miracle in the
            Mass, and cared little for a rigid literal interpretation of the
            words of the institution, had declared that the Sacrament of the
            Supper was the symbol of commemoration, of a covenant with God,
            and of the fellowship of all believers in Christ, and this
            commended itself to Zwingli's conception of the social character
            of Christianity; but he was too much a Christian theologian to be
            contented with such a vague idea of the rite. Many theologians of
            the later Middle Ages, when speculation was more free than it
            could be after the stricter definitions of the Council of Trent,
            had tried to purify and spiritualise the beliefs of the Church
            about the meaning of the central Christian rite. Foremost among
            them was John Wessel (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">c.</span></span> 1420-1489), with his long
            and elaborate treatise, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">De Sacramento Eucharistiæ</span></span>. He
            had taught that the Lord's Supper is the rite in which the death
            of Christ is presented to and appropriated by the believer; that
            it is above all things a commemoration of that death and a
            communion or participation in the benefits which followed; that
            communion with the spiritual presence of Jesus is of far more
            importance than any corporeal contact with the Body of Christ;
            and that this communion is shared in through faith. These
            thoughts had been taken over by Christopher Honius, a divine of
            the Netherlands, who had enforced them by insisting that our
            Lord's discourse in the 6th chapter of St. John's Gospel had
            reproved any materialistic conception of the Lord's Supper; and
            that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">therefore</span></em> the words of the
            institution must not be taken in their rigid literal meaning. He
            had been the first to suggest that the word <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> in
            <span class="tei tei-q">“This is My Body”</span> must mean
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">signifies</span></em>. Wessel and Honius
            were the predecessors of Zwingli, and <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> he wove their thoughts into his doctrine of
            the Lord's Supper. It should be remembered that Luther had also
            been acquainted with the labours of Wessel and of Honius, and
            that so far from attracting they had repelled him, simply because
            he thought they failed to give the respect due to the literal
            meaning of the words of the institution.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must not be
            forgotten that Luther knew Zwingli only as in some way connected
            with Andrew Bodenstein of Carlstadt. Carlstadt had professed to
            accept the theory of Honius about the nature of the relation of
            the Presence of Christ to the elements of Bread and Wine—saying
            that the latter were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">signs</span></em>, and nothing more, of the
            former. A controversy soon raged in Wittenberg to the scandal of
            German Protestantism. Luther insisted more and more on the
            necessity of the Presence in the elements of the Body of Christ
            <span class="tei tei-q">“corporeally extended in space”</span>;
            while Carlstadt denied that Presence in any sense whatsoever.
            Luther insisted with all the strength of language at his command
            that the literal sense of the words of the institution must be
            preserved, and that the words <span class="tei tei-q">“This is My
            Body”</span> must refer to the Bread and to the Wine; while
            Carlstadt thought it was more likely that while using the words
            our Lord pointed to His own Body, or if not, that religious
            conviction compelled another interpretation than the one on which
            Luther insisted.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dust of
            all this controversy was in the eyes of the theologians when they
            met at Marburg, and prevented them carefully examining each
            other's doctrinal position. In all essential matters Luther and
            Zwingli were not so far apart as each supposed the other to be.
            Their respective theories, put very shortly, may be thus summed
            up.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Zwingli,
            looking mainly at the mediæval doctrine of the Mass, taught: (1)
            The Lord's Supper is not a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">repetition</span></em> of the sacrifice of
            Christ on the Cross, but a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">commemoration</span></em> of that sacrifice
            once offered up; and the elements are not a newly offered Christ,
            but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">signs</span></em> of the Body and Blood of
            the Christ who was once for all offered on Calvary. (2) That
            forgiveness for sin is not won by <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">partaking</span></em> <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id=
            "Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in a newly offered Christ,
            but by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">believing</span></em> in a Christ once
            offered up. (3) That the benefits of the work of Christ are
            always appropriated by faith, and that the atonement is so
            appropriated in the sacrament, whereby Christ becomes our food;
            but the food, being neither carnal nor corporeal, is not
            appropriated by the mouth, but by faith indwelling in the soul.
            Therefore there is a Real Presence of Christ in the sacrament,
            but it is a spiritual Presence, not a corporeal one. A real and
            living faith always involves the union of the believer with
            Christ, and therefore the Real Presence of Christ; and the
            Presence of Christ, which is in every act of faith, is in the
            sacrament to the faithful partaker. (4) That while the Lord's
            Supper primarily refers to the sacrifice of Christ, and while the
            elements, Bread and Wine, are the symbols of the crucified Body
            of Christ, the partaking of the elements is also a symbol and
            pledge of an ever-renewed living union with the Risen Christ. (5)
            That as our Lord Himself has specially warned His followers
            against thinking of feeding on Him in any corporeal or carnal
            manner (John vi.), the words of the institution cannot be taken
            in a strictly literal fashion, and the phrase <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“This is My Body”</span> means <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“This signifies My Body.”</span> The fourth position
            had been rather implicitly held than explicitly stated.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther,
            looking mainly at the mediæval doctrine of the Eucharist, taught:
            (1) That the primary use of the sacrament was to bring believing
            communicants into direct touch with the Living Risen Christ. (2)
            That to this end there must be in the Bread and Wine the local
            Presence of the Glorified Body of Christ, which he always
            conceived as <span class="tei tei-q">“body extended in
            space”</span>; the communicants, coming into touch with this Body
            of Christ, have communion with Him, such as His disciples had on
            earth and as His saints now have in heaven. (3) That this local
            Presence of Christ does not presuppose any special priestly
            miracle, for, in virtue of its <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">ubiquity</span></em>, the Glorified Body of
            Christ is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">everywhere</span></em> naturally, and
            therefore is in the Bread and in the Wine: this natural Presence
            becomes a sacramental <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg
            358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            Presence because of the promise of God attached to the reverent
            and believing partaking of the sacrament. (4) That communion with
            the Living Risen Christ implies the appropriation of the Death of
            Christ, and of the Atonement won by this death; but this last
            thought of Luther's, which is Zwingli's first thought, lies
            implicitly in his teaching without being dwelt upon.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two
            theories, so far as doctrinal teaching goes, are supplementary to
            each other rather than antagonists. Each has a weak point.
            Luther's depends on a questionable mediæval idea of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">ubiquity</span></em>, and Zwingli's on a
            somewhat shallow exegesis. It was unfortunate, but only natural,
            that when the two theological leaders were brought together at
            Marburg, instead of seeking the mutual points of agreement, each
            should attack the weak point in the other's theory. Luther began
            by chalking the words <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Hoc est Corpus
            Meum</span></span> on the table before him, and by saying,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I take these words literally; if anyone
            does not, I shall not argue but contradict”</span>; and Zwingli
            spent all his argumentative powers in disputing the doctrine of
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">ubiquity</span></em>. The long debate went
            circling round these two points and could never be got away from
            them. Zwingli maintained that the Body of Christ was at the Right
            Hand of God, and could not be present, extended in space, in the
            elements, which were signs representing what was absent. Luther
            argued that the Body of Christ was in the elements, as, to use
            his own illustration, the sword is present in the sheath. As a
            soldier could present his sheathed sword and say, truly and
            literally, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">This is my sword</span></em>, although
            nothing but the sheath was visible; so, although nothing could be
            seen or felt but Bread and Wine, these elements in the Holy
            Supper could be literally and truly called the Body and Blood of
            Christ.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            substantial harmony revealed in the fourteen articles which they
            all could sign showed that the Germans and the Swiss had one
            faith. But Luther insisted that their difference on the Sacrament
            of the Supper prevented them becoming one visible brotherhood,
            and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg
            359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            immediate purpose of the Landgrave of Hesse was not
            fulfilled.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Undaunted by
            his defeat, Philip next attempted a less comprehensive union. If
            Luther and Zwingli could not be included within the one
            brotherhood, might not the German cities of the south and the
            Lutheran princes be brought together? Another conference was
            arranged at Schwabach (October 1529), when a series of
            theological articles were to be presented for agreement. Luther
            prepared seventeen articles to be set before the conference. They
            were based on the Marburg Articles; but as Luther had stated his
            own doctrine of the Holy Supper in its most uncompromising form,
            it is not to be wondered at that the delegates from the southern
            cities hesitated to sign. They said that the confession (for the
            articles took that form) was not in conformity with the doctrines
            preached among them, and that they would need to consult their
            fellow-citizens before committing them to it. Thus Philip's
            attempts to unite the Protestants of Germany failed a second
            time, and a divided Protestantism awaited the coming of the
            Emperor, who had resolved to solve the religious difficulty in
            person.</p>

            for his brother Ferdinand, by procuring his election as King of
            the Romans.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Charles came
            from Italy over the Brenner Pass in the spring time, and was
            magnificently received by the Tyrolese, eager to do all honour to
            the grandson of their beloved Kaiser Max. His letters to his
            brother, written on the stages of the journey, reveal as fully as
            that reserved soul could unbosom itself, his plans for the
            pacification of Germany. He meant to use every persuasion
            possible, to make what compromises his conscience permitted (for
            Catholicism was a faith with Charles), to effect a peaceful
            settlement. But if these failed, he was determined to crush the
            Reformation by force. He never seems to have doubted that he
            would succeed. Never a thought crossed his mind that he was about
            to encounter a great spiritual force whose depth and intensity he
            was unable to measure, and which was slowly creating a new world
            unknown to himself and to his contemporaries. While at Innsbruck
            he invited the Elector of Saxony to visit him, and was somewhat
            disappointed that the Lutheran prince did not accept; but this
            foretaste of trouble did not give him any uneasiness.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The summons to
            the Diet, commanding the Electors, princes, and all the Estates
            of the Empire to meet at Augsburg on the 8th of April 1530, had
            been issued when Charles was at Bologna. No threats marred the
            invitation. The Emperor announced that he meant to leave all past
            errors to the judgment of the Saviour; that he wished to give a
            charitable hearing to every man's opinions, thoughts, and ideas;
            and that his only desire was to secure that all might live under
            the one Christ, in one Commonwealth, one Church, and one
            Unity.<a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">333</span></span></a> He
            left Innsbruck on the 6th of June, and, travelling slowly,
            reached the bridge on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg
            361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the Lech, a little distance from Augsburg, on the evening of the
            15th. There he found the great princes of the Empire, who had
            been waiting his arrival from two o'clock in the afternoon. They
            alighted to do him reverence, and he graciously dismounted also,
            and greeted them with all courtesy. Charles had brought the papal
            nuncio, Cardinal Campeggio, in his train. Most of the Electors
            knelt to receive the cardinal's blessing; but John of Saxony
            stood bolt upright, and refused the proffered benediction.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            procession—one of the most gorgeous Germany had ever seen—was
            marshalled for the ceremonial entry into the town. The retinues
            of the Electors were all in their appropriate colours and
            arms—Saxony, by ancient prescriptive right, leading the van. Then
            came the Emperor alone, a baldachino carried over his head. He
            had wished the nuncio and his brother to ride beside him under
            the canopy; but the Germans would not suffer it; no Pope's
            representative was to be permitted to ride shoulder to shoulder
            with the head of the German Empire entering the most important of
            his imperial cities.<a id="noteref_334" name="noteref_334" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Augsburg was
            then at the height of its prosperity. It was the great trading
            centre between Italy and the Levant and the towns of Northern
            Europe. It was the home of the Welsers and of the Fuggers, the
            great capitalists of the later mediæval Europe. It boasted that
            its citizens were the equals of princes, and that its daughters,
            in that age of deeply rooted class distinctions, had married into
            princely houses. To this day the name of one of its
            streets—Philippine Welser Strasse—commemorates the wedding of an
            heiress of the Welsers with an archduke of Austria; and the wall
            decorations of the old houses attest the ancient magnificence of
            the city.<a id="noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the gates
            of the town, the clergy, singing <span class=

            procession. All, Emperor, clergy, princes, and their retinues,
            entered the cathedral. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Te Deum</span></span> was sung, and the
            Emperor received the benediction. Then the procession was
            re-formed, and accompanied Charles to his lodgings in the
            Bishop's Palace.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There the
            Emperor made his first attempt on his Lutheran subjects. He
            invited the Elector of Saxony, George of Brandenburg, Philip of
            Hesse, and Francis of Lüneburg to accompany him to his private
            apartments. He told them that he had been informed that they had
            brought their Lutheran preachers with them to Augsburg, and that
            he would expect them to keep them silent during the sittings of
            the Diet. They refused. Then Charles asked them to prohibit
            controversial sermons. This request was also refused. In the end
            Charles reminded them that his demand was strictly within the
            decision of 1526; that the Emperor was lord over the imperial
            cities; and he promised them that he would appoint the preachers
            himself, and that there would be no sermons—only the reading of
            Scripture without comment. This was agreed to. He next asked them
            to join him in the Corpus Christi procession on the following
            day. They refused—Philip of Hesse with arguments listened to by
            Ferdinand with indignation, and by Charles with indifference,
            probably because he did not understand German. The Emperor
            insisted. Then old George of Brandenburg stood forth, and told
            His Majesty that he could not, and would not obey. It was a
            short, rugged speech, though eminently respectful, and ended with
            these words, which flew over Germany, kindling hearts as fire
            lights flax: <span class="tei tei-q">“Before I would deny my God
            and His Evangel, I would rather kneel down here before your
            Majesty and have my head struck off,”</span>—and the old man hit
            the side of his neck with the edge of his hand. Charles did not
            need to know German to understand. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not
            head off, dear prince, not head off,”</span> he said kindly in
            his Flemish-German (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Nit Kop ab, löver Först, nit Kop
            ab</span></span>). Charles walked in procession through the
            streets of Augsburg on a blazing hot day, stooping under a heavy
            purple <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg

            means,”</span> to end the religious differences which were
            distracting Germany. The Protestants were again invited to give
            the Emperor in writing their opinions and difficulties. It was
            resolved to take the religious question first. On June 24th the
            Lutherans were ready with their <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“statement of their grievances and opinions relating
            to the faith.”</span> Next day (June 25th) the Diet met in the
            hall of the Episcopal Palace, and what is known as the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Augsburg Confession</span></span> was read
            by the Saxon Chancellor, Dr. Christian Bayer, in such a clear
            resonant voice that it was heard not only by the audience within
            the chamber, but also by the crowd which thronged the court
            outside.<a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href=

            When the reading was ended, Chancellor Brück handed the document
            and a duplicate in Latin to the Emperor. They were signed by the
            Elector of Saxony and his son John Frederick, by George, Margrave
            of Brandenburg, the Dukes Ernest and Francis of Lüneburg, the
            Landgrave of Hesse, Prince Wolfgang of Anhalt, and the delegates
            of the cities of Nürnberg and Reutlingen. These princes knew the
            danger which threatened them in putting their names to the
            Confession. The theologians of Saxony besought their Elector to
            permit their names <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg
            364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I, too, will
            confess my Christ</span></em>. He was not a brilliant man like
            Philip of Hesse. He was unpretentious, peace-loving, and retiring
            by nature—John the Steadfast, his people called him. Recent
            historians have dwelt on the conciliatory attitude and judicial
            spirit manifested by the Emperor at this Diet, and they are
            justified in doing so; but the mailed hand sometimes showed
            itself. Charles refused to invest John with his Electoral
            dignities in the usual feudal fashion, and his entourage
            whispered that if the Elector was not amenable to the Emperor's
            arguments, he might find the electorate taken from him and
            bestowed on the kindred House of Ducal Saxony, which in the
            person of Duke George so stoutly supported the old
            religion.<a id="noteref_339" name="noteref_339" href=

            had a genuine affection for the Emperor. Both recognised that
            this Diet of Augsburg had separated them irrevocably.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Uncle, Uncle,”</span> said Charles to
            Elector John at their parting interview, <span class=

            Elector's eyes filled with tears; he could not speak; he turned

            to belong to the ancient and visible Catholic Church, and to
            believe in all the articles of faith set forth by the Universal

            Creeds</span></span>; but they maintained that abuses had crept
            in which obscured the ancient doctrines. The Confession showed
            why they could not remain in connection with an unreformed
            Church. Their position is exactly defined in the opening sentence
            of the second part of the Confession. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Inasmuch as the Churches among us dissent in no
            articles of faith from the Holy Scriptures nor the Church
            Catholic, and only omit a few of certain abuses, which are novel,
            and have crept in with time partly and in part have been
            introduced by violence, and contrary to the purport of the
            canons, we beg that your Imperial Majesty would clemently hear
            both what ought to be changed, and what are the reasons why
            people ought not to be forced against their conscience to observe
            these abuses.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Confession
            is often represented as an attempt to minimise the differences
            between Lutherans and Romanists and exaggerate those between
            Lutherans and Zwinglians, and there are some grounds for the
            statement. Melanchthon had come back from the Diet of Speyer
            (1529) convinced that if the Lutherans had separated themselves
            more thoroughly from the cities of South Germany there would have
            been more chance of a working compromise, and it is only natural
            to expect that the idea should colour his sketch of the Lutheran
            position at Augsburg. Yet in the main the assertion is wrong. The
            distinctively Protestant conception of the spiritual priesthood
            of all believers inspires the whole document; and this can never
            be brought into real harmony with the Romanist position and
            claims. It is not difficult to state Romanist and Protestant
            doctrine in almost identical phrases, provided this one great
            dogmatic difference be for the moment set on one side. The
            conferences at Regensburg in 1541 (April 27-May 22) proved as
            much. No one will believe that Calvin would be inclined to
            minimise the differences between Protestants and Romanists, yet
            he voluntarily signed the Augsburg Confession, <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id=
            "Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and did so, he says, in the
            sense in which the author (Melanchthon) understood it. This
            Augsburg Confession and Luther's Short Catechism are the
            symbolical books still in use in all Lutheran churches.</p>

            divided into two parts, the first expressing the views held by
            those who signed it, and the second stating the errors they
            protested against. The form and language alike show that the
            authors had no intention of framing an exhaustive syllabus of
            theological opinions or of imposing its articles as a changeless
            system of dogmatic truth. They simply meant to express what they
            united in believing. Such phrases as <em class=

            opinions are falsely attributed to us</span></em>, make that
            plain. In the first part the authors show how much they hold in
            common with the mediæval Church; how they abide by the teaching
            of St. Augustine, the great theologian of the West; how they
            differ from more radical Protestants like the Zwinglians, and
            repudiate the teachings of the Anabaptists. The Lutheran doctrine
            of Justification by Faith is given very clearly and briefly in a
            section by itself, but it is continually referred to and shown to
            be the basis of many portions of their common system of belief.
            In the second part they state what things compel them to dissent
            from the views and practices of the mediæval Church—the enforced
            celibacy of the clergy, the sacrificial character of the Mass,
            the necessity of auricular confession, monastic vows, and the
            confusion of spiritual and secular authority exhibited in the
            German episcopate.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The origin of
            the document was this. When the Emperor's proclamation summoning
            the Diet reached Saxony, Chancellor Gregory Brück suggested that
            the Saxon theologians should prepare a statement of their
            opinions which might be presented to the Emperor if called
            for.<a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href=
            "#note_343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a>
            This was done. The theologians went to the <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id=
            "Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Schwabach Articles, and
            Melanchthon revised them, restated them, and made them as
            inoffensive as he could. The document was meant to give the
            minimum for which the Protestants contended, and Melanchthon's
            conciliatory spirit shows itself throughout. It embalms at the
            same time some of Luther's trenchant phrases: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Christian perfection is this, to fear God sincerely;
            and again, to conceive great faith, and to trust assuredly that
            God is pacified towards us for Christ's sake; to ask, and
            certainly to look for, help from God in all our affairs according
            to our calling; and outwardly to do good works diligently, and to
            attend to our vocation. In these things doth true perfection and
            the true worship of God consist: it doth not consist in being
            unmarried, in going about begging, nor in wearing dirty
            clothes.”</span> His indifference to forms of Church government
            and his readiness to conserve the old appears in the sentence:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Now our meaning is not to have rule
            taken from the bishops; but this one thing only is requested at
            their hands, that they would suffer the gospel to be purely
            taught, and that they would relax a few observances, which cannot
            be observed without sin.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
            Romanist theologians presented their Confutation of this
            Confession to the Emperor, it was again left to Melanchthon to
            draft an answer—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Apology of the Augsburg
            Confession</span></span>. The <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Apology</span></span> is about seven times
            longer than the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Confession</span></span>, and is a noble and
            learned document. The Emperor refused to receive it, and
            Melanchthon spent a long time over it before it was allowed to be
            seen.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After taking

            John Eck of Ingolstadt, Faber, and Cochlæus. There was little
            hope of arriving at a compromise with such champions on the papal
            side; and Charles was soon to discover that his strongest
            opponents in effecting a peaceful solution were the nuncio and
            his committee of theologians. Five times they produced a
            confutation, and five times the Emperor and the Diet returned
            their work, asking them to redraft it in milder and in less
            uncompromising terms.<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href=

            sixth draft went far beyond the wishes of Charles, but the
            Emperor had to accept it and let it appear as the statement of
            his beliefs. It made reconciliation hopeless.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The religious
            difficulty had not been removed by compromise. There remained
            force—the other alternative foreshadowed by the Emperor. The time
            seemed to be opportune. Protestantism was divided, and had
            flaunted its differences in the Emperor's presence. Philip of
            Hesse had signed the Augsburg Confession with hesitation, not
            because he did not believe its statements, but because it seemed
            to shut the door on a complete union among all the parties who
            had joined in the Protest of 1529. The four cities of Strassburg,
            Constance, Lindau, and Memmingen had submitted a separate
            Confession (the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Confessio Tetrapolitana</span></span>) to
            the Emperor; and the Romanist theologians had written a
            confutation of it also. Zwingli had sent a third.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther was not
            among the theologians present at the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Diet of Augsburg. Technically he was still
            an outlaw, for the ban of the Diet of Worms had never been
            legally removed. The Elector had asked him to stay at his Castle
            of Coburg. There he remained, worried and anxious, chafing like a
            caged eagle. He feared that Melanchthon's conciliatory spirit
            might make him barter away some indispensable parts of
            evangelical truth; he feared the impetuosity of the Landgrave of
            Hesse and his known Zwinglian sympathies. His secretary wrote to
            Wittenberg that he was fretting himself ill; he was longing to
            get back to Wittenberg, where he could at least teach his
            students. It was then that Catharine got their friend Lucas
            Cranach to paint their little daughter Magdalena, just twelve
            months old, and sent it to her husband that he might have a small
            bit of home to cheer him. Luther hung the picture up where he
            could always see it from his chair, and he tells us that the
            sweet little face looking down upon him gave him courage during
            his dreary months of waiting. Posts brought him news from the
            Diet: that the Confession had been read to the Estates; that the
            Romanists were preparing a Confutation; that their reply was
            ready on August 3rd; that Philip of Hesse had left the Diet
            abruptly on the 6th, to raise troops to fight the Emperor, it was
            reported; that Melanchthon was being entangled in conferences,
            and was giving up everything. His strong ardent nature pours
            itself forth in his letters from Coburg (April 18th-Oct.
            4th)—urging his friends to tell him how matters are going;
            warning Melanchthon to stand firm; taking comfort in the text,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye angry, and sin not”</span>;

              rolling over us with such a ponderous weight that they seemed
              like a great ocean, and yet I saw no foundation on which they
              rested or were based, and no shore which bounded them; yet they
              fell not, but frowned on us and flowed on. But when they had
              passed by, then there shone forth both their floor and our
              roof, which had kept them back—a rainbow! A frail, thin floor
              and roof which soon melted into the clouds, and was more like a
              shadowy prism, such as we see through coloured glass, than a
              strong, firm foundation, and we might well distrust the feeble
              rampart which kept back that fearful weight of waters. Yet we
              found that this unsubstantial prism was able to bear up the
              weight of waters, and that it guarded us safely! But there are
              some who look more to the thickness and massive weight of the
              waters and the clouds than at this thin, light, narrow bow of
              promise. They would like to feel the strength of that shadowy
              vanishing arch, and because they cannot do this, they are
              always fearing that the clouds will bring back the
              flood.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            Protestants never seemed to be in a worse plight; but, as Luther
            wrote, the threatened troubles passed away—for this time at
            least.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Campeggio was
            keen to crush the Reformation at once. His letters to the Curia
            insist that the policy of the strong arm is the only effectual
            way of dealing with the Lutheran princes. But Charles found that
            some of the South German princes who were eager that no
            compromise should be made with the Lutherans, were very unwilling
            to coerce them by force of arms. They had no wish to see the
            Emperor all-powerful in Germany. The Romanist Dukes of Bavaria
            (the Wittelsbachs) were as strongly anti-Hapsburg as Philip of
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name=
            "Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Hesse himself; and
            Charles had no desire to stir the anti-Hapsburg feeling. Instead,
            conferences<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href=
            "#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            were proposed to see whether some mutual understanding might not
            after all be reached; and the Diet was careful to introduce
            laymen, in the hope that they would be less uncompromising than
            the Romanist theologians. The meetings ended without any definite
            result. The Protestant princes refused to make the needful
            concessions, and Charles found his plans thwarted on every side.
            Whereupon the Romanist majority of the Diet framed a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“recess,”</span> which declared that the Protestants
            were to be allowed to exist unmolested until April 15th, 1531;
            and were then to be put down by force. Meanwhile they were
            ordered to make no more innovations in worship or in doctrine;
            they were to refrain from molesting the Romanists within their
            territories; and they were to aid the Emperor and the Romanist
            princes in stamping out the partisans of Zwingli and the
            Anabaptists. This resolution gave rise to a second Protest,
            signed by the Lutheran princes and by the fourteen cities.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing had
            stirred the wrath of Charles so much as the determined stand
            taken by the cities. He conceived that he, the Emperor, was the
            supreme Lord within an imperial city; and he employed persuasion
            and threats to make their delegates accept the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“recess.”</span> Even Augsburg refused.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having made
            their Protest, the Lutheran princes and the delegates from the
            protesting towns left the Diet, careless of what the Romanist
            majority might further do. In their absence an important
            ordinance was passed. The Diet decided that the Edict of Worms
            was to be executed; that the ecclesiastical jurisdictions were to
            be preserved, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg
            372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            and all Church property to be restored; and, what was most
            important, that the Imperial Court of Appeals for all disputed
            legal cases within the Empire (the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichskammersgericht</span></span>) should
            be restored. The last provision indicated a new way of fighting
            the extending Protestantism by harassing legal prosecutions,
            which, from the nature of the court, were always to be decided
            against the dissenters from the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of
            the mediæval Empire.<a id="noteref_351" name="noteref_351" href=
            "#note_351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a> All
            instances of seizure of ecclesiastical benefices, all defiances
            of episcopal decisions, could be appealed against to this central
            court; and as the legal principles on which it gave its decisions
            and the controlling authorities which it recognised were
            mediæval, the Protestants could never hope for a decision in
            their favour. The Lutheran Church in Saxony, for example, with
            its pastors and schoolmasters, was supported by moneys taken from
            the old ecclesiastical foundations. According to this decision of
            the Diet, every case of such transfer of property could be
            appealed to this central court, which from its constitution was
            bound to decide against the transfer. If the Protestant princes
            disregarded the decisions of the central court, the Emperor was
            within his rights in treating them as men who had outraged the
            constitution of the Empire.<a id="noteref_352" name="noteref_352"

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Charles met at
            Augsburg the first great check in his hitherto successful career,
            but he was tenacious of purpose, and never cared to hurry matters
            to an irrevocable conclusion. He carefully studied the problem,
            and three ways of dealing with the religious difficulty shaped
            themselves in his mind at Augsburg—by compromise, by letting the
            Protestants alone for a period longer or shorter, and by a
            General Council which would be free. It would seem <span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Emperor
            published the decision of the Diet on the 19th of November, and
            the Protestants had to arrange some common plan of facing the
            situation. They met, princes and delegates of cities, in the
            little upland town of Schmalkalden, lying on the south-west
            frontier of Electoral Saxony, circled by low hills which were
            white with snow (December 22-31). They had to face at once
            harassing litigation, and, after the 15th of April, the threat
            that they would be stamped out by force of arms. Were they still
            to maintain their doctrine of passive resistance? The question
            was earnestly debated. Think of these earnest German princes and
            burghers, their lives and property at stake, debating this
            abstract question day after day, resolute to set their own
            consciences right before coming to any resolution to defend
            themselves! The lawyers were all on the side of active defence.
            The terms of the bond were drafted. The Emperor's name was
            carefully omitted; and the causes which compelled them to take
            action were rather alluded to vaguely than stated with precision.
            The Elector of Saxony, the Landgrave of Hesse, the Duke of
            Lüneburg, the Prince of Anhalt, the two Counts of Mansfeld, and
            the delegates from Magdeburg and Bremen signed. Pious old George
            of Brandenburg was not convinced that it was lawful to resist the
            Emperor; the deputies of Nürnberg had grave doubts also. Many
            others who were present felt that they must have time to make up
            their minds. But the league was started, and was soon to assume
            huge proportions.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg
            374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            confederates had confessed the new doctrines, and had published
            their Confession. They now resolved that they would defend
            themselves if attacked by litigation or otherwise. There was no
            attempt to exclude the South German cities; and Charles'
            expectations that theological differences would prevent
            Protestant union within Germany were frustrated. Zwingli's heroic
            death at Cappel (October 11th, 1531) softened all Protestant
            hearts towards his followers. The South German cities followed
            the lead of Bucer, who was anxious for union. Many of these towns
            now joined the Schmalkald League. Brunswick joined. Hamburg and
            Rostock in the far north, Goslar and Göttingen in the centre,
            joined. Almost all North Germany and the more important imperial
            towns in the South were united in one strong confederacy by this
            Schmalkald League. It became one of the European Powers. Denmark
            wished to join. Thomas Cromwell was anxious that England should
            join. The league was necessarily anti-Hapsburg, and the Emperor
            had to reckon with it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Its power
            appeared at the Diet of Nürnberg in 1532. The dreaded day (April
            15th, 1531) on which the Protestants were to be reduced by fire
            and sword passed quietly by. Charles was surrounded with
            difficulties which made it impossible for him to carry out the
            threats he had published on November 19th, 1530. The Turks were
            menacing Vienna and the Duchy of Austria; the Pope was ready to
            take advantage of any signs of imperial weakness; France was
            irreconcilable; England was hostile; and the Bavarian dukes were
            doing what they could to lessen the Hapsburg power in
            Germany.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the Diet
            met at Nürnberg in 1532, the Emperor knew that he was unable to
            coerce the Lutherans, and returned to his earlier courteous way
            of treating them. They were more patriotic than the German
            Romanists for whom he had done so much. Luther declared roundly
            that the Turks must be met and driven back, and that all Germans
            must support the Emperor in repelling the invasion. At the Diet a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“recess”</span> was proposed, in which
            the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name=
            "Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> religious truce
            was indefinitely extended; the processes against the Protestants
            in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichskammersgericht</span></span> were to
            be quashed, and no State was to be proceeded against in matters
            arising out of religious differences. The Romanist members
            refused to accept it; the <span class="tei tei-q">“recess”</span>
            was never published. But the Protestant States declared that they
            would trust in the imperial word of honour, and furnished the
            Emperor with troops for the defence of Vienna, and the invasion
            was repelled.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The history of
            the struggle in Germany between the Diet of 1532 and the outbreak
            of war in 1546 is very intricate, and cannot be told as a simple
            contest between Reformation and anti-Reformation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            sixteenth century, almost all thoughtful and earnest-minded men
            desired a Reformation of the Church. The Roman Curia was the only
            opponent to all reforms of any kind. But two different ideas of
            what Reformation ought to be, divided the men who longed for
            reforms. The one desired to see the benumbed and formalist
            mediæval Church filled with a new religious life, while it
            retained its notable characteristics of a sacerdotal ministry and
            a visible external unity under a uniform hierarchy culminating in
            the Papacy. The other wished to free the human spirit from the
            fetters of a merely ecclesiastical authority, and to rebuild the
            Church on the principle of the spiritual priesthood of all
            believing men and women. In the struggle in Germany the Emperor
            Charles may be taken as the embodiment of the first, as Luther
            represented the second. To the one it seemed essential to
            maintain the external unity and authority of the Church according
            to the mediæval ideal; the other could content himself with
            seeing the Church of the Middle Ages broken up into territorial
            Churches, each of which he contended was a portion of the one
            visible Catholic Church. Charles had no difficulty in accepting
            many changes in doctrine and usages, provided a genuine and
            lasting compromise could be arrived at which would retain all
            within the one ecclesiastical organisation. He consented
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name=
            "Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> once and again to
            suspend the struggle; but he would never have made himself
            responsible for a permanent religious settlement which recognised
            the Lutheran Churches. He had no objection to a truce, but would
            never accept a lasting peace. If the Lutherans could not be
            brought back within the mediæval Church by compromise, then he
            was prepared to go to all extremes to compel them to return. Of
            course, he was the ruler over many lands; he was keen to extend
            and consolidate the family possessions of his House,—as keen as
            the most grasping of the petty territorial princes,—and he had to
            be an opportunist. But he never deviated in the main from his
            idea of how the religious difficulty should be solved.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But all manner
            of political and personal motives were at work on both sides in
            Germany (as elsewhere). Philip of Hesse combined a strenuous
            acceptance of the principles of the Lutheran Reformation with as
            thorough a hatred of the House of Hapsburg and of its supremacy
            in Germany. The Dukes of Bavaria, who were the strongest
            partisans of the Romanist Church in Germany, were the hereditary
            enemies of the House of Austria. The religious pacification of
            the Fatherland was made impossible to Charles, not merely by his
            insistence on maintaining the conceptions of the mediæval Church,
            but also by open and secret reluctance to see the imperial
            authority increased, and by jealousies aroused by the territorial
            aggrandisement of the House of Hapsburg. The incompatibility
            between the aims of the Emperor and those of his indispensable
            ally, the Pope, added to the difficulties of the situation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1534,
            Philip of Hesse persuaded the Schmalkald League to espouse the
            cause of the banished Duke of Würtemberg. His territories had
            been incorporated into the family possessions of the Hapsburgs,
            and the people groaned under the imperial administration. The
            Swabian League, which had been the mainstay of the Imperialist
            and Romanist cause in South Germany, was persuaded to remain
            neutral by the Dukes of Bavaria, and Philip had <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id=
            "Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> little difficulty in
            defeating Ferdinand, and driving the Imperialists out of the
            Duchy. Ulrich was restored, declared in favour of the Lutheran
            Reformation, and Würtemberg was added to the list of Protestant
            States. By the terms of the Peace of Cadan (June 1534), Ferdinand
            publicly engaged to carry out Charles' private assurance that no
            Protestant was to be dragged before the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichskammersgericht</span></span> for
            anything connected with religion.<a id="noteref_354" name=
            "noteref_354" href="#note_354"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a>
            Another important consequence followed. The Swabian League was
            dissolved in 1536. This left the Schmalkald League of Protestant
            States and cities the only formidable confederation in
            Germany.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The political
            union among the Protestants suggested a closer approximation. The
            South German pastors asked to meet Luther and discuss their
            theological differences. They met at Wittenberg, and after
            prolonged discussion it was found that all were agreed save on
            one small point—the presence, <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extended in
            space</span></em>, of the Body of Christ in the elements in the
            Holy Supper. It was agreed that this might be left an open
            question; and what was called the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wittenberg
            Concord</span></span> was signed, which united all German
            Protestants (May and June 1536).<a id="noteref_355" name=
            "noteref_355" href="#note_355"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three years
            later (1539), Duke George of Saxony died, the most honest and
            disinterested of the Romanist princes. His brother Henry, who
            succeeded him, with the joyful consent of his subjects,
            pronounced for the Evangelical faith. Nothing would content him
            but that Luther should come to Leipzig to preside clerically on
            so auspicious an occasion. Luther preached in the great hall of
            the Castle, where twenty years earlier he had confronted Eck, and
            had heard Duke George declare that his opinions were
            pestilential.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the same
            year the new Elector of Brandenburg also came over to the
            Evangelical side amid the rejoicings of his people; and the two
            great Romanist States of North <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page378">[pg 378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Germany, Electoral Brandenburg and Ducal
            Saxony, became Protestant.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tide
            flowed so strongly that the three clerical Electors, the
            Archbishops of Mainz, Köln, and Trier, and some of the bishops,
            contemplated secularising their principalities, and becoming
            Protestants. This alarmed Charles thoroughly. If the proposed
            secularisation took place, there would be a large Protestant
            majority in the Electoral College, and the next Emperor would be
            a Protestant.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Charles had
            been anxiously watching the gradual decadence of the power of the
            Romanist princes in Germany; and reports convinced him that the
            advance of the Reformation among the people was still more
            marked. The Roman Catholic Church seemed to be in the agonies of
            dissolution even in places where it had hitherto been strong.
            Breslau, once strongly Romanist, was now almost fanatically
            Lutheran; in Vienna, Bishop Faber wrote, the population was
            entirely Lutheran, save himself and the Archduke. The Romanist
            Universities were almost devoid of students. In Bavaria, it was
            said that there were more monasteries than monks. Candidates for
            the priesthood had diminished in a very startling way: the nuncio
            Vergerio reported that he could find none in Bohemia except a few
            paupers who could not pay their ordination fees.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The policy of
            the Pope (Paul <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">iii.</span></span>, 1534-1549) had
            disgusted the German Romanist princes. He subordinated the
            welfare of the Church in their dominions to his anti-Hapsburg
            Italian schemes, and had actually allied himself with Francis of
            France, who was intriguing with the Turks, in order to thwart the
            Emperor! The action and speeches of Henry <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">viii.</span></span> had been watched
            and studied by the German Romanist leaders. Could they not
            imitate him in Germany, and create a Nationalist Church true to
            mediæval doctrine, hierarchy, and ritual, and yet independent of
            the Pope, who cared so little for them?</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these
            things made Charles and Ferdinand revise <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> their policy. The Emperor began to consider
            seriously whether the way out of the religious difficulty might
            not be, either to grant a prolonged truce to the Lutherans (which
            might, though he hoped not, become permanent), or to work
            energetically for the creation of a German National Church,
            which, by means of some working compromise in doctrines and
            ceremonies, might be called into existence by a German National
            Council assembled in defiance of the Pope.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was with
            these thoughts in his mind that he sent his Chancellor Held into
            Germany to strengthen the Romanist cause there. His agent soon
            abandoned the larger ideas of his master, if he ever comprehended
            them, and contented himself with announcing publicly that the
            private promise given by Charles at Nürnberg, and confirmed by
            Ferdinand at the Peace of Cadan, was withdrawn. The lawsuits
            brought against the Protestants in the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichskammersgericht</span></span> were not
            to be quashed, but were to be prosecuted to the bitter end. He
            also contrived at Nürnberg (June 1538) to form a league of
            Romanist princes, ostensibly for defence, but really to force the
            Protestants to submit to the decisions of the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reichskammersgericht</span></span>. These
            measures did not make for peace; they almost produced a civil
            war, which was only avoided by the direct interposition of the
            Emperor.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Chancellor
            Held was recalled, and the Emperor sent the Archbishop of Lund to
            find out what terms the Protestants would accept. These proved
            larger than the Emperor could grant, but the result of the
            intercourse was that the Protestants were granted a truce which
            was to last for ten years.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proposed
            secularisation of the ecclesiastical Electorates made Charles see
            that he dared not wait for the conclusion of this truce. He set
            himself earnestly to discover whether compromises in doctrine and
            ceremonies were not possible. Conferences were held between
            Lutheran and Romanist theologians and laymen, at Hagenau (June
            1540), at Worms (November 1540), and at Regensburg <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id=
            "Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> (Ratisbon, April 1541).<a id=
            "noteref_356" name="noteref_356" href="#note_356"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a> The
            last was the most important. The discussions showed that it was
            possible to state Romanist and Lutheran doctrine in ambiguous
            propositions which could be accepted by the theologians of both
            Confessions; but that there was a great gulf between them which
            the Evangelicals would never re-cross. The spiritual priesthood
            of all believers could never be reconciled with the special
            priesthood of the mediæval clergy. This was Charles' last attempt
            at a compromise which would unite of their own free will the
            German Lutherans with the German Romanists. He saw that the
            Lutherans would never return to the mediæval Church unless
            compelled by force, and it was impossible to use force unless the
            Schmalkald League was broken up altogether or seamed with
            divisions.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            opportunity arrived. The triumphant Protestantism received its
            severest blow in the bigamy of Philip of Hesse, which involved
            the reputations of Bucer, Luther, and Melanchthon, as well as of
            the Landgrave.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Philip had
            married when barely nineteen a daughter of Duke George of Saxony.
            Latterly, he declared that it was impossible to maintain conjugal
            relations with her; that continence was impossible for him; that
            the condition in which he found himself harassed his whole life,
            and prevented him coming to the Lord's Table. In a case like his,

            which he submitted to the theologians, and got a reply signed by
            Bucer, Melanchthon, and Luther, which may be thus
            summarised:—</p>

            <span style="font-size: 90%">According to the original
            commandment of God, marriage is between one man and one woman,
            and the twain shall become one flesh, and this original precept
            has been confirmed by our Lord; but sin brought it about that
            first Lamech, then the heathen, and then Abraham, took more than
            one wife, and this was permitted by the law. We are now living
            under the gospel, which does not give prescribed rules for the
            regulation of the external life, and it has not expressly
            prohibited bigamy. The existing law of the land has gone back to
            the original requirement of God, and the plain duty of the
            pastorate is to insist on that original requirement of God, and
            to denounce bigamy in every way. Nevertheless the pastorate, in
            individual cases of the direst need, and to prevent worse, may
            sanction bigamy in a purely exceptional way; such a bigamous
            marriage is a true marriage (the necessity being proved) in the
            sight of God and of conscience; but it is not a true marriage
            with reference to public law or custom. Therefore such a marriage
            ought to be kept secret, and the dispensation which is given for

            thing could not be kept secret, and the moral effect of the
            revelation was disastrous among friends and foes. The Evangelical
            princes were especially aggrieved; and it was proposed that the
            Landgrave should be tried for bigamy and punished according to
            the laws of the Empire. When the matter was brought before the
            Emperor, he decided that no marriage had taken place, and the
            sole effect of the decision of the theologians was to deceive a
            poor maiden.<a id="noteref_358" name="noteref_358" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Philip,
            humiliated and sore, isolated from his friends, was an instrument
            ready to the Emperor's hand in his plan to weaken and, if
            possible, destroy the Schmalkald League. The opportunity soon
            arrived. The father of William Duke of Cleves Juliers and Berg
            had been elected by the Estates of Guelders to be their
            sovereign, in defiance of a treaty which had secured the
            succession to Charles. The father died, and the son succeeded
            almost immediately after the treaty had been signed. This created
            a powerful anti-Hapsburg State in close proximity to the
            Emperor's possessions in the Netherlands. William of Cleves had
            married his sister Sibylla to John Frederick, the Elector of
            Saxony, and naturally gravitated towards the Schmalkald League.
            In 1541 an arrangement was come to between the Emperor and
            Philip, according to which Philip guaranteed to prevent the Duke
            of Cleves from joining the League, or at least from being
            supported by it against the Emperor, and in return Philip was
            promised indemnity for all past deeds, and advancement in the
            Emperor's service. Young Maurice of Ducal Saxony, who had
            succeeded his father in the Duchy (August 18th, 1541), and had
            married Philip's daughter, also joined in this bargain. The
            Emperor had thus divided the great Protestant League; for the
            Elector of Saxony refused to desert his brother-in-law. In 1543
            the Emperor fell upon the unbefriended Duke, totally defeated
            him, and took Guelders from him, while the German Protestants,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name=
            "Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> hindered by
            Philip, saw one of their most important allies overthrown. This
            gave rise to recriminations, which effectually weakened the
            Protestant cause.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1544,
            Charles concluded a peace with France (the Peace of Crépy,
            November 19th), and was free to turn his attention to affairs in
            Germany. He forced the Pope in the same month to give way about a
            General Council, which was fixed to meet in March 1545. The
            Emperor meant this Council to be an instrument in his hands to
            subdue both the Protestants and the Pope. He meant it to reform
            the Church in the sense of freeing it from many of the
            corruptions which had found their way into it, and especially in
            diminishing the power of the Roman Curia; and in this he was
            supported by the Spanish bishops and by the greater part of Latin
            Christendom. But the Pope was the more skilful diplomatist, and
            out-generalled the Emperor. The Council was summoned to meet at
            Trent, a purely Italian town, though nominally within Germany. It
            was arranged that all its members must be present personally and
            not by deputies, which meant that the Italian bishops had a
            permanent majority; and the choice of Dominicans and Jesuits as
            the leading theologians made it plain that no doctrinal
            concessions would be made to the Protestants. From the first the
            Protestants refused to be bound in any way by its decisions, and
            Charles soon perceived that the instrument he had counted on had
            broken in his hands. If ecclesiastical unity was to be maintained
            in Germany, it could only be by the use of force. There is no
            doubt that the Emperor was loath to proceed to this last
            extremity; but his correspondence with his sister Mary and with
            his brother Ferdinand shows that he had come to regard it as a
            necessity by the middle of 1545.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His first
            endeavour was to break up the Protestant League, which was once
            more united. He attempted again to detach Philip of Hesse, but
            without success. He was able, however, to induce the Elector of
            Brandenburg and the Margrave of Brandenburg-Culmbach and some
            others to remain neutral—the Elector by promising in any event
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name=
            "Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that the religious
            settlement which had been effected in Brandenburg (1541) should
            remain unaltered; and, what served him best, he persuaded young
            Maurice of Ducal Saxony to become his active ally.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Maurice of
            Saxony was one of the most interesting, because one of the most
            perplexing personalities of his time, which was rich in
            interesting personalities. He was a Protestant from conviction,
            and never wavered from his faith; yet in the conflict between the
            Romanist Emperor and the Protestant princes he took the Emperor's
            side, and contributed more than any one else to the overthrow of
            his fellow Protestants. His bargain with Charles was that the
            Electorate should be transferred from the Ernestine Saxon family
            to his own, the Albertine, that he should get Magdeburg and
            Halberstadt, and that neither he nor his people should be subject
            to the decrees of the Council of Trent. Then, when he had
            despoiled the rival family of the Electorate, he planned and
            carried through the successful revolt of the Protestant princes
            against the Emperor, and was mainly instrumental in securing the
            public recognition of Lutheranism in Germany and in gaining the
            permanent Religious Peace of 1555.<a id="noteref_359" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was in
            these months, while the alarms of war were threatening Germany,
            that Luther passed away. He had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> been growing weaker year by year, and had
            never spared himself for the cause he had at heart. One last bit
            of work he thought he must do. The Counts of Mansfeld had
            quarrelled over some trifling things in the division of their
            property, and had consented to accept Luther's mediation. This
            obliged him to journey to Eisleben in bitterly cold weather
            (January 1546). <span class="tei tei-q">“I would cheerfully lay
            down my bones in the grave if I could only reconcile my dear
            Lords,”</span> he said; and that was what was required from him.
            He finished the arbitration to the satisfaction of both brothers,
            and received by way of fee endowments for village schools in the
            Mansfeld region. The deeds were all signed by the 17th of
            February (1546), and Luther's work was done at Mansfeld—and for
            his generation. He became alarmingly ill that night, and died on
            the following morning, long before dawn. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Reverend Father,”</span> said Justus Jonas, who was
            with him, <span class="tei tei-q">“wilt thou stand by Christ and
            the doctrine thou hast preached?”</span> The dying man roused
            himself to say <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span> It was his
            last word. Twenty minutes later he passed away with a deep
            sigh.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther died in
            his sixty-third year—twenty-eight and a half years after he had,
            greatly daring, nailed his Theses to the door of All Saints' in
            Wittenberg, twenty-seven after he had discovered the meaning of
            his Theses during the memorable days when he faced Eck at
            Leipzig, and twenty-five after he had stood before the Emperor
            and Diet at Worms, while all Germany had hailed him as its
            champion against the Pope and the Spaniard. The years between
            1519 and 1524 were, from an external point of view, the most
            glorious of Luther's life. He dominated and led his nation, and
            gave a unity to that distracted and divided country which it had
            never enjoyed until then. He spoke and felt like a prophet.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I have the gospel, not from men, but
            from heaven through our Lord Jesus Christ, so that I might have
            described myself and have glorified in being a minister and an
            evangelist.”</span> The position had come to him in no sudden
            visionary way. He had been led into it step by step, forced
            forward slowly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg
            386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            by a power stronger than his own; and the knowledge had kept him
            humble before his God. During these years it seemed as if his
            dream—an expectation shared by his wise Elector, the most
            experienced statesman in Germany—of a Germany united under one
            National Church, separated from the bondage of Rome, repudiating
            her blasphemies, rejecting her traditions which had corrupted the
            religion of the ancient and purer days, and disowning her
            presumptuous encroachments on the domain of the civil power
            ordained of God, was about to come true.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then came the
            disillusionment of the Peasants' War, when the dragon's teeth
            were sown broadcast over Germany, and produced their crop of
            gloomy suspicions and black fears. After the insurrection had
            spent itself, and in spite of the almost irretrievable damage
            which it, and the use made of it by papal diplomatists, did to
            the Reformation movement, Luther regained his serene courage, and
            recovered much of the ground which had been lost. But the
            crushing blow had left its mark upon him. He had the same trust
            in God, but much more distrust of man, fearing the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“tumult,”</span> resolute to have nothing to do with
            anyone who had any connection, however slight, with those who had
            instigated the misguided peasants. He rallied the forces of the
            Reformation, and brought them back to discipline by the faith
            they had in himself as their leader. His personality dominated
            those kinglets of Germany, possessed with as strong a sense of
            their dignity and autocratic rights as any Tudor or Valois, and
            they submitted to be led by him. Electoral Saxony, Hesse,
            Lüneburg, Anhalt, East Prussia, and Mansfeld, and some score of
            imperial cities, had followed him loyally from the first; and as
            the years passed, Ducal Saxony and Würtemberg in the centre and
            south, and Brandenburg in the north, had declared themselves
            Protestant States. These larger principalities brought in their
            train all the smaller satellite States which clustered round
            them. It may be said that before Luther's death the much larger
            portion of the German Empire had been won for evangelical
            religion,—a territory <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg
            387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            to be roughly described as a great triangle, whose base was the
            shores of the Baltic Sea from the Netherlands on the west to the
            eastern limits of East Prussia, and whose apex was Switzerland.
            Part of this land was occupied by ecclesiastical principalities
            which had remained Roman Catholic,—the districts surrounding Köln
            on the west, and the territories of Paderborn, Fulda, and many
            others in the centre,—but, on the other hand, many stoutly
            Protestant cities, like Nürnberg, Constance, and Augsburg, were
            planted on territories which were outside these limits. The
            extent and power of this Protestant Germany was sufficient to
            resist any attempt on the part of the Emperor and the Catholic
            princes to overcome it by force of arms, provided only its rulers
            remained true to each other.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Over this wide
            extent of country Evangelical Churches had been established, and
            provisions had been made for the education of children and for
            the support of the poor in ordinances issued by the supreme
            secular authorities who ruled over its multitudinous divisions.
            The Mass, with its supposed substitutionary sacrifice and a
            mediatorial priesthood, had been abolished. The German tongue had
            displaced mediæval Latin in public worship, and the worshippers
            could take part in the services with full understanding of the
            solemn acts in which they were engaged. A German Bible lay on
            every pulpit, and the people had their copies in the pews.
            Translations of the Psalms and German evangelical hymns were
            sung, and sermons in German were preached. Pains were taken to
            provide an educated evangelical ministry who would preach the
            gospel faithfully, and conscientiously fulfil all the duties
            connected with the <span class="tei tei-q">“cure of
            souls.”</span> The ecclesiastical property of the mediæval Church
            was largely used for evangelical purposes. There was no
            mechanical uniformity in these new arrangements. Luther refused

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The movement
            Luther had inaugurated had gone far beyond Germany before 1546.
            Every country in Europe had felt its pulsations. As early as 1519
            (April), learned men in Paris had been almost feverishly studying
            his writings.<a id="noteref_360" name="noteref_360" href=

            Aleander, writing from Worms to the Curia, complains that Spanish

            Lutheran Reformation had been legally established in Denmark,
            Norway, and Sweden long before Luther passed away.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther was the
            one great man of his generation, standing head and shoulders
            above everyone else. This does not mean that he absorbed in his
            individual personality everything that the age produced for the
            furtherance of humanity. Many impulses for good existed in that
            sixteenth century which Luther never recognised; for an age is
            always richer than any one man belonging to it. He stood outside
            the great artistic movement. He might have learned much from
            Erasmus on the one hand, and from the leaders of the Peasants'
            War on the other, which remained hidden from him. He is greatest
            in the one sphere of religion only—in the greatest of all
            spheres. His conduct towards Zwingli and the strong language he
            used in speaking of opponents make our generation discover a
            strain of intolerance we would fain not see in so great a man;
            but his contemporaries did not and could not pass the same
            judgment upon him. In such a divided Germany none but a man of
            the widest tolerance could have held together the Protestant
            forces as Luther did; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg

            and we can see what he was when we remember the sad effects of
            the petty orthodoxies of the Amsdorfs and the Osianders who came
            after him.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is the fate
            of most authors of revolutions to be devoured by the movement
            which they have called into being. Luther occasioned the greatest
            revolution which Western Europe has ever seen, and he ruled it
            till his death. History shows no kinglier man than this
            Thuringian miner's son.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The war began
            soon after Luther's death. The Emperor brought into Germany his
            Spanish infantry, the beginning of what was to be a curse to that
            country for many generations, and various manœuvrings and
            skirmishes took place, the most important of which was Maurice of
            Saxony's invasion of the Electorate. At last the Emperor met the
            Elector in battle at Mühlberg (April 24th, 1547), where John
            Frederick was completely defeated and taken prisoner. Wittenberg,
            stoutly defended by Sibylla, soon after surrendered. This was the
            end. Philip was induced to surrender on promise of favourable
            treatment, made by the Electors who had remained on the Emperor's
            side. Charles refused to be bound by the promise made in his
            name, and the Landgrave was also held captive. All Germany, save
            Constance in the south and some of the Baltic lands, lay
            prostrate at the Emperor's feet. It remained to be seen what use
            he would make of his victory.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In due time he
            set himself to bring about what he conceived to be a reasonable
            compromise which would enable all Germany to remain within one
            National Church. He tried at first to induce the separate parties
            to work <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg
            390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            it out among themselves; and, when this was found to be hopeless,
            he, like a second Justinian, resolved to construct a creed and to
            impose it by force upon all, especially upon the Lutherans. To
            begin with, he had to defy the Pope and slight the General
            Council for which he had been mainly responsible. He formally
            demanded that the Council should return to German soil (it had
            been transferred to Bologna), and, when this was refused, he
            protested against its existence and, like the German Protestants
            he was coercing, declared that he would not submit to its
            decrees. He next selected three theologians, Michael Helding,
            Julius von Pflug, and Agricola,—a mediævalist, an Erasmian, and a
            very conservative Lutheran—to construct what was called the

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This document
            taught the dogma of Transubstantiation, the seven Sacraments,
            adoration of the Blessed Virgin and the Saints, retained most of
            the mediæval ceremonies and usages, and declared the Pope to be
            the Head of the Church. This was to please the Romanists. It
            appealed to the Lutherans by adopting the doctrine of
            Justification by Faith in a modified form, the marriage of
            priests with some reservations, the use of the Cup by the laity
            in the Holy Supper, and by considerably modifying the doctrine of
            the sacrificial character of the Mass. Of course all its
            propositions were ambiguous, and could be read in two ways. This
            was probably the intention of the framers; if so, they were
            highly successful.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing that
            Charles ever undertook proved such a dismal failure as this
            patchwork creed made from snippets from two Confessions. However
            lifeless creeds may become, they all—real ones—have grown out of
            the living Christian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg

            experience of their framers, and have contained the very
            life-blood of their hearts as well as of their brains. It is a
            hopeless task to construct creeds as a tailor shapes and stitches
            coats.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Charles,
            however, was proud of his creed, and did his best to enforce it.
            The Diet of 1548 showed him his difficulties. The <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Interim</span></span> was accepted and
            proclaimed as an edict by this Diet (May 15), but only after the
            Emperor, very unwillingly, declared practically that it was meant
            for the Protestants alone. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
            Emperor,”</span> said a member of the Diet, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“is fighting for religion against the Pope, whom he
            acknowledges to be its head, and against the two parts of
            Christendom in Germany—the mass of the Protestants and the
            ecclesiastical princes.”</span> Thus from the beginning what was
            to be an instrument to unite German Christendom was transformed
            into a <span class="tei tei-q">“strait-waistcoat for the
            Lutherans”</span>; and this did not make it more palatable for
            them. At first the strong measures taken by the Emperor compelled
            its nominal acceptance by many of the Protestant princes.<a id=
            "noteref_366" name="noteref_366" href="#note_366"><span class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">366</span></span></a> The
            cities which seemed to be most refractory had their Councils
            purged of their democratic members, and their Lutheran preachers
            sent into banishment—Matthew Alber from Reutlingen, Wolfgang
            Musculus from Augsburg, Brenz from Hall, Osiander from Nürnberg,
            Schnepf from Tübingen. Bucer and Fagius had to flee from
            Strassburg and take refuge in England. The city of Constance was
            besieged and fell after a heroic defence; it was deprived of its
            privileges as an imperial city, and was added to the family
            possessions of the House of Austria. Its pastor, Blarer, was sent
            into banishment. Four hundred Lutheran divines were driven from
            their homes.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If Charles,
            backed by his Spanish and Italian troops, could secure a nominal
            submission to his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Interim</span></span>, he could not coerce
            the people into accepting it. The churches stood empty in
            Augsburg, in Ulm, and in other cities. The <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg 392]</span><a name="Pg392" id=
            "Pg392" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> people met it by an almost
            universal passive resistance—if singing doggerel verses in
            mockery of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Interim</span></span> may be called passive.
            When the Emperor ordered Duke Christopher of Würtemberg to drive
            Brenz out of his refuge in his State, the Duke answered him that
            he could not banish his whole population. The popular feeling, as
            is usual in such cases, found vent in all manner of satirical
            songs, pamphlets, and even catechisms. As in the times before the
            Peasants' War, this coarse popular literature had an immense
            circulation. Much of it took the form of rude broadsides with a
            picture, generally satirical, at the top, and the song, sometimes
            with the music score, printed below.<a id="noteref_367" name=
            "noteref_367" href="#note_367"><span class=

            Wandering preachers, whom no amount of police supervision could
            check, went inveighing against the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Interim</span></span>, distributing the rude
            literature through the villages and among the democracy in the
            towns. Soon the creed and the edict which enforced it became
            practically a dead letter throughout the greater part of
            Germany.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The presence
            of the Emperor's Spanish troops on the soil of the Fatherland
            irritated the feelings of Germans, whether Romanists or
            Protestants; the insolence and excesses of these soldiers stung
            the common people; and their employment to enforce the hated
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Interim</span></span> on the Protestants was
            an additional insult. The citizens of one imperial city were told
            that if they did not accept the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Interim</span></span> they must be taught
            theology by Spanish troops, and of another that they would yet
            learn to speak the language of Spain. While the popular odium
            against Charles was slowly growing in intensity, he contrived to
            increase it by a proposal that his son Philip should have the
            imperial crown after his brother Ferdinand. Charles' own election
            had been caused by a patriotic sentiment. The people thought that
            a German was better than a Frenchman, and they had found out too
            late that they had not got a German but a Spaniard. Ferdinand had
            lived in Germany long enough to know its wants, and his son
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a name=
            "Pg393" id="Pg393" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Maximilian had
            shown that he possessed many qualities which appealed to the
            German character. The proposal to substitute Philip, however
            natural from Charles' point of view, and consistent with his
            earlier idea that the House of Hapsburg should have one head,
            meant to the Germans to still further <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“hispaniolate”</span> Germany. This unpopularity of
            Charles among all ranks and classes of Germans grew rapidly
            between 1548 and 1552; and during the same years his foreign
            prestige was fast waning. He remained in Germany, with the
            exception of a short visit to the Netherlands; but in spite of
            his presence the anarchy grew worse and worse. The revolt which
            came might have arisen much sooner had the Protestants been able
            to overcome their hatred and suspicion of Maurice of Saxony,
            whose co-operation was almost essential. It is unnecessary to
            describe the intrigues which went on around the Emperor, careless
            though not unforewarned.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Maurice had
            completed his arrangements with his German allies and with France
            early in 1552. The Emperor had retired from Augsburg to
            Innsbruck. Maurice seized the Pass of Ehrenberg on the nights of
            May 18th, 19th, and pressed on to Innsbruck, hoping to
            <span class="tei tei-q">“run the old fox to earth.”</span>
            Charles escaped by a few hours, and, accompanied by his brother
            Ferdinand, fled over the Brenner Pass amid a storm of snow and
            rain. It was the road by which he had entered Germany in fair
            spring weather when he came in 1530, in the zenith of his power,
            to settle, as he had confidently expected, the religious
            difficulties in Germany. He reached Villach in Carinthia in
            safety, and there waited the issue of events.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The German
            princes gathered in great numbers at Passau (Aug. 1552) to
            discuss the position and arrive at a settlement. Maurice was
            ostensibly the master of the situation, for his troops and those
            of his wild ally Albert Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Culmbach were
            in the town, and many a prince felt <span class="tei tei-q">“as
            if they had a hare in their breast.”</span> His demands for the
            public good were moderate and statesmanlike. He asked for the
            immediate release of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg
            394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            his father-in-law the Landgrave of Hesse; for a settlement of the
            religious question on a basis that would be permanent, at a
            meeting of German princes fairly representative of the two
            parties—no Council summoned and directed by the Pope would ever
            give fair-play to the Protestants, he said, nor could they expect
            to get it from the Diet where the large number of ecclesiastical
            members gave an undue preponderance to the Romanist side; and for
            a settlement of some constitutional questions. The princes
            present, and with them Ferdinand, King of the Romans, were
            inclined to accept these demands. But when they were referred to
            Charles at Villach, he absolutely refused to permit the religious
            or the constitutional question to be settled by any assembly but
            the Diet of the Empire. Nothing would move him from his opinion,
            neither the entreaties of his brother nor his own personal
            danger. He still counted on the divisions among the Protestants,
            and believed that he had only to support the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“born Elector”</span> of Saxony against the one of
            his own creation to deprive Maurice of his strength. It may be
            that Maurice had his own fears, it may be that he was glad to
            have the opportunity of showing that the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Spaniard”</span> was the one enemy to a lasting
            peace in Germany. He contented himself with the acquiescence of
            John Frederick in the permanent loss of the Electorate as
            arranged at the Peace of Wittenberg (1547).</p>

            then free to come back to Augsburg, where he had the petty
            satisfaction of threatening the Lutheran preachers who had
            returned, and of again overthrowing the democratic government of
            the city. He then went to assume the command of the German army
            which was opposing the French. His failure to take the city of
            Metz was followed by his practical abandonment of the direction
            of the affairs of Germany, which were left in the hands of
            Ferdinand. The disorders of the time delayed the meeting of the
            Diet until 1555 (opened Feb. 5th). The Elector and the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“born Elector”</span> of Saxony were both
            dead—John Frederick, worn out by misfortune and imprisonment
            (March 3rd, 1554), and sympathised with by <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name="Pg395" id=
            "Pg395" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> friends and foes alike; and
            Maurice, only thirty-two years of age, killed in the moment of
            victory at Sievershausen (July 9th, 1553).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was in the
            summer of 1554 that the Emperor had handed over, in a carefully
            limited manner, the management of German affairs to his brother
            Ferdinand, the King of the Romans. The terms of devolution of
            authority imply that this was done by Charles to avoid the
            humiliation of being personally responsible for acquiescence in
            what was to him a hateful necessity, and the confession of
            failure in his management of Germany from 1530. Everyone
            recognised that peace was necessary at almost any price, but
            Ferdinand and the higher ecclesiastical princes shrunk from
            facing the inevitable. The King of the Romans still cherished
            some vague hopes of a compromise which would preserve the unity
            of the mediæval German Church, and the selfish policy of many of
            the Protestant princes encouraged him. Elector Joachim of
            Brandenburg wished the archbishopric of Magdeburg and the
            bishopric of Halberstadt for his son Sigismund, and declared that
            he would be content with the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Interim</span></span>!
            Christopher of Würtemberg cherished similar designs on
            ecclesiastical properties. Augustus of Saxony, Maurice's brother
            and successor, wished the bishopric of Meissen. All these designs
            could be more easily fulfilled if the external unity of the
            mediæval Church remained unbroken.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Diet had
            been summoned for Nov. 13th (1554), but when Ferdinand reached
            Augsburg about the end of the year, the Estates had not gathered.
            He was able to open the Diet formally on Feb. 5th (1555), but
            none of the Electors, and only two of the great ecclesiastical
            princes, the Cardinal Bishop of Augsburg and the Bishop
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name=
            "Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Eichstadt, were
            present in person. While the Diet dragged on aimlessly, the
            Protestant princes gathered to a great Council of their own at
            Naumburg (March 3rd, 1555) to concert a common policy. Among
            those present were the Electors of Brandenburg and Saxony, the
            sons of John Frederick, the ill-fated <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“born Elector,”</span> and the Landgrave of
            Hesse—sixteen princes and a great number of magnates. After long
            debates, the assembly decided (March 13th) that they would stand
            by the Augsburg Confession of 1530, and that the minority would
            unite with the majority in carrying out one common policy. Even
            <span class="tei tei-q">“fat old Interim,”</span> as Elector
            Joachim of Brandenburg had been nicknamed, was compelled to
            submit; and the Protestants stood on a firm basis with a definite
            programme, and pledged to support each other.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This memorable
            meeting at Naumburg forced the hands of the members of the Diet.
            Every member, save the Cardinal Bishop of Augsburg, desired a
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">permanent</span></em> settlement of the
            religious question, and their zeal appeared in the multiplicity
            of adjectives used to express the predominant
            thought—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">beständiger, beharrlicher, unbedingter, für
            und für ewig währender</span></span>”</span> was the phrase. The
            meeting at Naumburg showed them that this could not be secured
            without the recognition of Lutheranism as a legal religion within
            the German Empire.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
            Protestant demands were formally placed before the Diet, they
            were found to include—security under the Public Law of the Empire
            for all who professed the Augsburg Confession, and for all who in
            future might make the same profession; liberty to hold legally
            all the ecclesiastical property which had been or might in the
            future be secularised; complete toleration for all Lutherans who
            were resident in Romanist States without corresponding toleration
            for Romanists in Lutheran States. These demands went much further
            than any which Luther himself had formulated, and really applied
            to Romanists some of the provisions of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“recess”</span> of Speyer (1529) which, when applied
            to Lutherans, had called forth the Protest. <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page397">[pg 397]</span><a name="Pg397" id=
            "Pg397" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> They were vehemently objected
            to by the Romanist members of the Diet; and, as both parties
            seemed unwilling to yield anything to the other, there was some
            danger of the religious war breaking out again. The mediation of
            Ferdinand for the Romanists and Frederick of Saxony for the
            Protestants brought a compromise after months of debate. It was
            agreed that the Lutheran religion should be legalised within the
            Empire, and that all Lutheran princes should have full security
            for the practice of their faith; that the mediæval episcopal
            jurisdiction should cease within their lands; and that they were
            to retain all ecclesiastical possessions which had been
            secularised before the passing of the Treaty of Passau (1552).
            Future changes of faith were to be determined by the principle
            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">cujus regio ejus
            religio</span></span>. The secular territorial ruler might choose
            between the Romanist or the Lutheran faith, and his decision was
            to bind all his subjects. If a subject professed another religion
            from his prince, he was to be allowed to emigrate without
            molestation. These provisions were agreed upon by all, and
            embodied in the <span class="tei tei-q">“recess.”</span> Two very
            important matters remained unsettled. The Romanists demanded that
            any ecclesiastical prince who changed his faith should thereby
            forfeit lands and dignities—the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“ecclesiastical reservation.”</span> This was
            embodied in the <span class="tei tei-q">“recess,”</span> but the
            Protestants declared that they would not be bound by it. On the
            other hand, the Protestants demanded toleration for all Lutherans
            living within the territories of Romanist princes. This was not
            embodied in the <span class="tei tei-q">“recess,”</span> though
            Ferdinand promised that he would see it carried out in
            practice.<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href=
            "#note_369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            Such was the famous Peace of Augsburg. There was no reason why it
            should not have come years earlier and without the wild war-storm
            which preceded it, save the fact that, in an unfortunate fit of
            enthusiasm, the Germans had elected the young King of Spain to be
            their Emperor. They had chosen the grandson of the genial
            Maxmilian, believing him to be a real German, and they got a man
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a name=
            "Pg398" id="Pg398" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> whose attitude to
            religion <span class="tei tei-q">“was half-way between the genial
            orthodoxy of his grandfather Maxmilian and the gloomy fanaticism
            of his son Philip <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span>,”</span> and whose
            <span class="tei tei-q">“mind was always travelling away from the
            former and towards the latter position.”</span><a id=
            "noteref_370" name="noteref_370" href="#note_370"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">370</span></span></a> The
            longer he lived the more Spanish he became, and the less capable
            of understanding Germany, either on its secular or religious
            side. His whole public life, so far as that country was
            concerned, was one disastrous failure. He succeeded only when he
            used his imperial position to increase and consolidate the
            territorial possessions of the House of Hapsburg; for the charge
            of dismembering the Empire can be brought home to Charles as
            effectually as to the most selfish of the princes of Germany.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Religious
            Peace of Augsburg was contained in the decisions of Speyer in
            1526, and it was repeated in every one of the truces which the
            Emperor made with his Lutheran subjects from 1530 to 1544.<a id=
            "noteref_371" name="noteref_371" href="#note_371"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">371</span></span></a> Had
            any one of these been made permanent, the religious war, with its
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg 399]</span><a name=
            "Pg399" id="Pg399" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> outcome in wild
            anarchy, in embittered religious antagonisms, and its seed of
            internecine strife, to be reaped in the Thirty Years' War, would
            never have occurred. But Charles, whose mission, he fancied, was
            to preserve the unity <span class="tei tei-q">“of the seamless
            robe of Christ,”</span> as he phrased it, could only make the
            attempt by drenching the fields of Germany with blood, and
            perpetuating and accentuating the religious antagonisms of the
            country which had chosen him for its Protector.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Religious
            Peace of Augsburg has been claimed, and rightly, as a victory for
            religious liberty.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From one point
            of view the victory was not a great one. The only Confession
            tolerated was the Augsburg. The Swiss Reformation and its
            adherents were outside the scope of the religious peace. What
            grew to be the Reformed or Calvinistic Church was also outside.
            It was limited solely to the Lutheran, or, as it was called, the
            Evangelical creed. Nor was there much gain to the personal
            liberty of conscience. It may be said with truth that there was
            less freedom of conscience under the Lutheran territorial system
            of Churches, and also under the Roman Catholic Church reorganised
            under the canons and decrees of Trent, than there was in the
            mediæval Church.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The victory
            lay in this, that the first blow had been struck to free mankind
            from the fetters of Romanist absolutism; that the first faltering
            step had been taken on the road to religious liberty; and the
            first is valuable not for what it is in itself, but for what it
            represents and for what comes after it. The Religious Peace of
            Augsburg did not concede much according to modern standards; but
            it contained the potency and promise of the future. It is always
            the first step which counts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two conceptions,
          the second being derived from the first, lay at the basis of
          everything which Luther said or did about the organisation of the
          Christian fellowship into churches.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The primary and
          cardinal doctrine, which was the foundation of everything, was the
          spiritual priesthood of all believers. This, he believed, implied
          that preaching, dispensing the sacraments, ecclesiastical
          discipline, and so forth were not the exclusive possession of a
          special caste of men to whom they had been committed by God, and
          who therefore were mediators between God and man. These divine
          duties belonged to the whole community as a fellowship of believing
          men and women; but as a division of labour was necessary, and as
          each individual Christian cannot undertake such duties without
          disorder ensuing, the community must seek out and set apart certain
          of its members to perform them in its name.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg 401]</span><a name="Pg401" id="Pg401"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
          conception was that secular government is an ordinance ordained of
          God, and that the special rule claimed by the Roman Pontiff over
          things secular and sacred was a usurpation of the powers committed
          by God to the secular authority. This Luther understood to mean
          that the Christian magistracy might well represent the Christian
          community of believers, and, in its name or associated with it,
          undertake the organisation and superintendence of the Church civic
          or territorial.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In his earlier
          writings, penned before the outbreak of the Peasants' War, Luther
          dwells most on the thought of the community of believers, their
          rights and powers; in the later ones, when the fear of the common
          man had taken possession of him, the secular authority occupies his
          whole field of thought. But although, before the Peasants' War,
          Luther does not give such a fixed place to the secular magistracy
          as the one source of authority or supervision over the Church, the
          conception was in his mind from the first.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          various duties which belong to the company of believers, Luther
          selected three as the most outstanding,—those connected with the
          pastorate, including preaching, dispensing the sacraments, and so
          forth; the service of Christian charity; and the duty of seeing
          that the children belonging to the community, and especially
          <span class="tei tei-q">“poor, miserable, and deserted
          children,”</span> were properly educated and trained to become
          useful members of the commonwealth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the few
          instances of attempts made before the Peasants' War to formulate
          those conceptions into regulations for communities organised
          according to evangelical principles, we find the community and the
          magistracy combining to look after the public worship, the poor,
          and education. Illustrations may be seen in the Wittenberg
          ordinance of 1522 (Carlstadt), and the ordinances of Leisnig (1523)
          and Magdeburg (1524).<a id="noteref_373" name="noteref_373" href=
          "#note_373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">373</span></span></a> All
          three are examples of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page402">[pg
          402]</span><a name="Pg402" id="Pg402" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          local authority within a small community endeavouring, at the
          prompting of preachers and people, to express in definite
          regulations some of the demands of the new evangelical life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther himself
          thought these earlier regulations premature, and insisted that the
          Wittenberg ordinance should be cancelled. He knew that changes must
          come; but he hoped to see them make their way gradually, almost
          imperceptibly, commending themselves to everyone without special
          enactment prescribed by external authority. He published
          suggestions for the dispensation of the Lord's Supper and of
          Baptism in the churches in Wittenberg as early as 1523; he
          collected and issued a small selection of evangelical hymns which
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">might</span></em> be sung in Public Worship
          (1524); during the same year he addressed the burgomasters and
          councillors of all German towns on the erection and maintenance of
          Christian schools; and he congratulated more than one municipality
          on provisions made for the care of the poor.<a id="noteref_374"

          all, he had, while in Wartburg, completed a translation of the New
          Testament which, after revision by Melanchthon and other friends,
          was published in 1522 (Sept. 21st), and went through sixteen
          revised editions and more than fifty reimpressions before 1534. The
          translation of the Old Testament was made by a band of scholars at
          Wittenberg, published in instalments, and finally in complete form
          in 1534.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He always
          cherished the hope that the evangelical faith would spread quietly
          all over his dear Fatherland if only room were made for the
          preaching of the gospel. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg
          403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          This of itself, he thought, would in due time effect a peaceful
          transformation of the ecclesiastical life and worship. The Diets of
          Nürnberg and Speyer had provided a field, always growing wider, for
          this quiet transformation. Luther was as indifferent to forms of
          Church government as John Wesley, and, like Wesley, every step he
          took in providing for a separate organisation was forced upon him
          as a practical necessity. To the very last he cherished the hope
          that there might be no need for any great change in the external
          government of the Church. The Augsburg Confession itself (1530)
          concludes with the words. <span class="tei tei-q">“Our meaning is
          not to have rule taken from the bishops; but this one thing only is
          requested at their hands, that they would suffer the gospel to be
          purely taught, and that they would relax a few observances, which
          cannot be held without sin. But if they will remit none, let them
          look how they will give account to God for this, that by their
          obstinacy they afford cause of division and schism, which it were
          yet fit they should aid in avoiding.”</span><a id="noteref_375"
          name="noteref_375" href="#note_375"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a> It
          was not that he believed that the existence of the visible Catholic
          Church depended on what has been ambiguously called an apostolic
          succession of bishops, who, through gifts conferred in ordination,
          create priests, who in turn make Christians out of natural heathen
          by the sacraments. He did not believe that ordination needed a
          bishop to confer it; he made his position clear upon this point as
          early as 1525, and ordination was practised without bishops from
          that date. But he had no desire to make changes for the sake of
          change. The Danish Church is at once episcopal and Lutheran to this
          day.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It ought also to
          be remembered that Luther and all the Reformers believed and held
          firmly the doctrine of a visible Catholic Church of Christ, and
          that the evangelical movement which they headed was the outcome of
          the centuries of saintly life <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">within</span></em> that visible Catholic
          Church. They never for a moment supposed that in withdrawing
          themselves from the authority of the Bishop <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a name="Pg404" id="Pg404"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Rome they were separating themselves
          from the visible Church. Nor did they imagine that in making
          provision, temporary or permanent, for preaching the word, the
          dispensation of the sacraments, the exercise of discipline, and so
          forth, they were founding a new Church, or severing themselves from
          that visible Church within which they had been baptized. They
          refused to concede the term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Catholic</span></span> to their opponents, and
          in the various conferences which they had with them, the Roman
          Catholics were always <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">officially</span></em> designated <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the adherents of the old religion,”</span> while they
          were termed <span class="tei tei-q">“the associates of the Augsburg
          Confession.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther cherished
          the hope, as late as 1545, that there might not need to be a
          permanent change in the external form of the Church in Germany; and
          this gives all the earlier schemes for the organisation of
          communities professing the evangelical faith somewhat of a
          makeshift and temporary appearance, which they in truth
          possessed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Diet of
          Speyer of 1526 gave the evangelical princes and towns the right,
          they believed, to reorganise public worship and ecclesiastical
          organisation within their dominions, and this right was largely
          taken advantage of. Correspondents from all quarters asked Luther's
          advice and co-operation, and we can learn from his answers that he
          was anxious there should be as much local freedom as possible,—that
          communities should try to find out what suited them best, and that
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“use”</span> of Wittenberg should not
          be held to regulate the custom of all other places.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was less
          difficult for the authorities in the towns to take over the charge
          of the ecclesiastical arrangements. They had during mediæval times
          some experience in the matter; and city life was so compact that it
          was easy to regulate the ecclesiastical portion. The prevailing
          type exhibited in the number of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“ordinances”</span> which have come down to us,
          collected by Richter and Sehling, is that a superintendent, one of
          the city clergy, was placed over the city churches, and that he was
          more or less responsible to the city fathers <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> for the ecclesiastical life and rule
          within the domains of the city.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          ecclesiastical organisation of the territories of the princes was a
          much more difficult task. Luther proposed to the Elector of Saxony
          that a careful visitation of his principality should be made,
          district by district, in order to find out the state of matters and
          what required to be done.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          correspondence of Luther during the years 1525-1527 shows how
          urgent the need of such a visitation appeared to him. He had been
          through the country several times. Parish priests had laid their
          difficulties before him and had asked his advice. His letters
          describe graphically their abounding poverty, a poverty increased
          by the fact that the only application of the new evangelical
          liberty made by many of the people was to refuse to pay all
          clerical dues. He came to the conclusion that the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“common man”</span> respected neither priest nor
          preacher, that there was no ecclesiastical supervision in the
          country districts, and no exercise of authority to maintain even
          the necessary ecclesiastical buildings. He expressed the fear that
          if things were allowed to go on as they were doing, there would be
          soon neither priest's house nor schools nor scholars in many a
          parish. The reports of the first Saxon Visitation showed that
          Luther had not exaggerated matters.<a id="noteref_376" name=
          "noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a> The
          district about Wittenberg was in much better order than the others;
          but in the outlying portions a very bad state of things was
          disclosed. In a village near Torgau the Visitors discovered an old
          priest who was hardly able to repeat the Creed or the Lord's
          Prayer,<a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377" href=
          "#note_377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a> but
          who was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg
          406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          held in high esteem as an exorcist, and who derived a good income
          from the exercise of his skill in combating the evil influences of
          witches. Priests had to be evicted for gross immoralities. Some
          were tavern-keepers or practised other worldly callings. Village
          schools were rarely to be found. Some of the peasants complained
          that the Lord's Prayer was so long that they could not learn it;
          and in one place the Visitors found that not a single peasant knew
          any prayer whatsoever.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Saxon
          Visitation was the model for similar ones made in almost every
          evangelical principality, and its reports serve to show what need
          there was for inquiry and reorganisation. The lands of Electoral
          Saxony were divided into four <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“circles,”</span> and a commission of theologians and
          lawyers was appointed to undertake the duties in each circle. The
          Visitation of the one <span class="tei tei-q">“circle”</span> of
          Wittenberg, with its thirty-eight parishes, may be taken as an
          example of how the work was done, and what kinds of alterations
          were suggested. The commissioners or Visitors were Martin Luther
          and Justus Jonas, theologians, with Hans Metzsch, Benedict Pauli,
          and Johann v. Taubenheim, jurists. They began in October 1528, and
          spent two months over their task. It was a strictly business
          proceeding. There is no account of either Luther or Jonas preaching
          while on tour. The Visitors went about their work with great
          energy, holding conferences with the parish priests and with the
          representatives of the community. They questioned the priests about
          the religious condition of the people—whether there was any gross
          and open immorality, whether the people were regular in their
          attendance at church and in coining to the communion. They asked
          the people how the priests did their work among them—in the towns
          their conferences were with the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rath</span></span>,
          and in the country districts <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page407">[pg 407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> and villages with the male heads of families.
          Their common work was to find out what was being done for the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“cure of souls,”</span> the instruction of
          the youth, and the care of the poor. By <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“cure of souls”</span> (<span lang="de" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Seelsorge</span></span>) they meant preaching,
          dispensation of the sacraments, catechetical instruction, and the
          pastoral visitation of the sick. It belonged to the theologians to
          estimate the capacities of the pastors, and to the jurists to
          estimate the available income, to look into all legal difficulties
          that might arise, and especially to clear the entanglements caused
          by the supposed jurisdiction of convents over many of the
          parishes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This small
          district was made up of three outlying portions of the three
          dioceses of Brandenburg, Magdeburg, and Meissen. It had not been
          inspected within the memory of man, and the results of episcopal
          negligence were manifest. At Klebitz the peasants had driven away
          the parish clerk and put the village herd in his house. At Bülzig
          there was neither parsonage nor house for parish clerk, and the
          priest was non-resident. So at Danna; where the priest held a
          benefice at Coswig, and was, besides, a chaplain at Wittenberg,
          while the clerk lived at Zahna. The parsonages were all in a bad
          state of repair, and the local authorities could not be got to do
          anything. Roofs were leaking, walls were crumbling, it was believed
          that the next winter's frost would bring some down bodily. At
          Pratau the priest had built all himself—parsonage, out-houses,
          stable, and byre. All these things were duly noted to be reported
          upon. As for the priests, the complaints made against them were
          very few indeed. In one case the people said that their priest
          drank, and was continually seen in the public-house. Generally,
          however, the complaints, when there were any, were that the priest
          was too old for his work, or was so utterly uneducated that he
          could do little more than mumble the Mass. There was scanty
          evidence that the people understood very clearly the evangelical
          theology. Partaking the Lord's Supper in both <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“kinds,”</span> or in one only, was the distinction
          recognised and appreciated between the new and the old teaching;
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name=
          "Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and when they had
          the choice the people universally preferred the new. In one case
          the parishioners complained that their priest insisted on saying
          the Mass in Latin and not in German. In one case only did the
          Visitors find any objection taken to the evangelical service. This
          was at Meure, where the parish clerk's wife was reported to be an
          enemy of the new pastor because he recited the service in German.
          It turned out, however, that her real objection was that the pastor
          had displaced her husband. At Bleddin the peasants told the
          Visitors that their pastor, Christopher Richter, was a learned and
          pious man, who preached regularly on all the Sundays and festival
          days, and generally four times a week in various parts of the
          parish. It appeared, however, that their admiration for him did not
          compel them to attend his ministrations with very great regularity.
          The energetic pastors were all young men trained at Wittenberg. The
          older men, peasants' sons all of them, were scarcely better
          educated than their parishioners, and were quite unable to preach
          to them. The Visitors found very few parishes indeed where three,
          four, five or more persons were not named to them who never
          attended church or came to the Lord's Table; in some parishes men
          came regularly to the preaching who never would come to the
          Sacrament. What impressed the Visitors most was the ignorance, the
          besotted ignorance, of the people. They questioned them directly;
          found out whether they knew the Apostles' Creed, the Ten
          Commandments, and the Lord's Prayer; and then questioned them about
          the meanings of the words; and the answers were disappointing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther came back
          from the Visitation in greatly depressed spirits, and expressed his
          feelings in his usual energetic language. He says in his
          introduction to his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          as soon as he returned from the Visitation:</p>

            discovered lately when I acted as a Visitor. Merciful God, what
            misery have I seen, the common people knowing nothing at all of
            Christian doctrine, especially in the villages! and unfortunately
            many pastors are well-nigh unskilled and incapable of teaching;
            and although all are called Christians and partake of the Holy
            Sacrament, they know neither the Lord's Prayer, nor the Creed,
            nor the Ten Commandments, but live like poor cattle and senseless
            swine, though, now that the gospel is come, they have learnt well
            enough how they may abuse their liberty. Oh, ye bishops, how will
            ye ever answer for it to Christ that ye have so shamefully
            neglected the people, and have not attended for an instant to
            your office? May all evil be averted from you!

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Visitors
          found that few books were to be seen in the parsonages. They record
          one notable exception, the parsonage of Schmiedeberg, where the
          priest had a library of twelve volumes. It could not be expected
          that such uneducated men could preach to much edification; and one
          of the recommendations of the Visitors was that copies of Luther's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Postils</span></span> or short sermons on the
          Lessons for the Day should be sent to all the parishes, with orders
          that they should be read by the pastors to their congregations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They did not
          find a trace anywhere of systematic pastoral visitation or
          catechising.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In their
          practical suggestions for ending the priestly inefficiency, the
          Visitors made simple and homely arrangements. To take one
          example,—at Liessnitz, the aged pastor Conrad was quite unable from
          age and ignorance to perform his duties; but he was a good,
          inoffensive old man. It was arranged that he was to have a
          coadjutor, who was to be boarded by the rich man of the parish and
          get the fees, while the old pastor kept the parsonage and the
          stipend, out of which he was to pay fourteen gulden annually to his
          coadjutor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Visitors
          found that schools did not exist in most of the villages, and they
          were disappointed with the condition <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page410">[pg 410]</span><a name="Pg410" id="Pg410" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the schools they found in the smaller
          towns. It was proposed to make the parish clerks the village
          schoolmasters; but they were wholly incompetent, and the Visitors
          saw nothing for it but to suggest that the pastors must become the
          village schoolmasters. The parish clerks were ordered to teach the
          children to repeat the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Small Catechism</span></span> by rote, and the
          pastors to test them at a catechising on Sunday afternoons. In the
          towns, where the churches usually had a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cantor</span></em>
          or precentor, this official was asked to train the children to sing
          evangelical hymns.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In their
          inquiries about the care of the poor, the Visitors found that there
          was not much need for anything to be done in the villages; but the
          case was different in the towns. They found that in most of them
          there existed old foundations meant to benefit the poor, and they
          discovered all manner of misuses and misappropriations of the
          funds. Suggestions were made for the restoration of these funds to
          their destined uses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This very
          condensed account of what took place in the Wittenberg <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“circle”</span> shows how the work of the Visitors was
          done; a second and a third Visitation were needed in Electoral
          Saxony ere things were properly arranged; but in the end good work
          was accomplished. The Elector refused to take any of the
          confiscated convent lands and possessions for civil purposes, and
          these, together with the Church endowments, provided stipends for
          the pastors, salaries for the schoolmasters, and a settled
          provision for the poor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
          Visitation was completed and the reports presented, the Visitors
          were asked to draft and issue an <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Instruction</span></span> or lengthy advice to
          the clergy and people of the <span class=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Instruction</span></span> was not considered a
          regular legal document, but its contents were expected to be acted
          upon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
          Visitations and Instructions were the earliest attempts at the
          reorganisation of the evangelical Church in Electoral Saxony. The
          Visitors remained as a <span class="tei tei-q">“primitive
          evangelical consistory”</span> to supervise their <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“circles.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Saxon
          Visitations became a model for most of the <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a name="Pg411" id="Pg411" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> North German evangelical territorial
          Churches, and the Instructions form the earliest collection of
          requirements set forth for the guidance of pastors and Christian
          people. The directions are very minute. The pastors are told how to
          preach, how to conduct pastoral visitations, what sins they must
          specially warn their people against, and what example they must
          show them. The care of schools and of the poor was not
          forgotten.<a id="noteref_378" name="noteref_378" href=
          "#note_378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact that
          matrimonial cases were during the Middle Ages almost invariably
          tried in ecclesiastical courts, made it necessary to provide some
          legal authority to adjudicate upon such cases when the mediæval
          episcopal courts had either temporarily or permanently lost their
          authority. This led to a provisional arrangement for the government
          of the Church in Electoral Saxony, which took a regular legal form.
          A pastor, called a superintendent, was appointed in each of the
          four <span class="tei tei-q">“circles”</span> into which the
          territory had been divided for the purpose of Visitation, to act
          along with the ordinary magistracy in all ecclesiastical matters,
          including the judging in matrimonial cases.<a id="noteref_379"
          name="noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a> This
          Saxon arrangement also spread largely through the northern German
          evangelical States.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A third
          Visitation of Electoral Saxony was made in 1532, and led to
          important ecclesiastical changes which formed the basis of all that
          came afterwards. As a result of the reports of the Visitors, of
          whom Justus Jonas seems to have been the most energetic, the
          parishes were rearranged, the incomes of parish priests readjusted,
          and the whole ecclesiastical revenues of the mediæval Church within
          Electoral Saxony appropriated for the threefold evangelical uses of
          supporting the ministry, providing for schools, and caring for the
          poor. The doctrine, ceremonies, and worship of the evangelical
          Church were also settled on a definite basis.<a id="noteref_380"
          name="noteref_380" href="#note_380"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page412">[pg 412]</span><a name="Pg412" id="Pg412" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Visitors
          pointed out that hitherto no arrangement had been made to give the
          whole ecclesiastical administration one central authority. The
          Electoral Prince had always been regarded as the supreme ruler of
          the Church within his dominions, but as he could not personally
          superintend everything, there was needed some supreme court which
          could act in all ecclesiastical cases as his representative or
          instrument. The Visitors suggested the revival of the mediæval
          episcopal consistorial courts modified to suit the new
          circumstances. Bishops in the mediæval sense of the word might be
          and were believed to be superfluous, but their true function, the
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">jus episcopale</span></span>, the right of
          oversight, was indispensable. According to Luther's ideas—ideas
          which had been gaining ground in Germany from the last quarter of
          the fifteenth century—this <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">jus
          episcopale</span></span> belonged to the supreme secular authority.
          The mediæval bishop had exercised his right of oversight through a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">consistorial court</span></em> composed of
          theologians and canon lawyers appointed by himself. These mediæval
          courts, it was suggested, might be transformed into Lutheran
          ecclesiastical courts if the prince formed a permanent council
          composed of lawyers and divines to act for him and in his name in
          all ecclesiastical matters, including matrimonial cases. The
          Visitors sketched their plan; it was submitted for revision to
          Luther and to Chancellor Brück, and the result was the Wittenberg
          Ecclesiastical Consistory established in 1542.<a id="noteref_381"
          name="noteref_381" href="#note_381"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">381</span></span></a> That
          the arrangement was still somewhat provisional appears from the
          fact that the court had not jurisdiction over the whole of the
          Electoral dominions, and that other two Consistories, one at Zeitz
          and the other at Zwickau, were established with similar powers. But
          the thing to be observed is that these courts were modelled on the
          old mediæval consistorial episcopal courts, and that, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a name="Pg413" id="Pg413"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> like them, they were composed of
          lawyers and of theologians. The essential difference was that these
          Lutheran courts were appointed by and acted in the name of the
          supreme secular authority. In Electoral Saxony their local bounds
          of jurisdiction did not correspond to those of the mediæval courts.
          It was impossible that they should. Electoral Saxony, the ordinance
          erecting the Consistory itself says, consisted of portions of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“ten or twelve”</span> mediæval dioceses.
          The courts had different districts assigned to them; but in all
          other things they reproduced the mediæval consistorial courts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          constitutions of these courts provided for the assembling and
          holding of Synods to deliberate on the affairs of the Church. The
          General Synod consisted of the Consistory and the superintendents
          of the various <span class="tei tei-q">“circles”</span>; and
          particular Synods, which had to do with the Church affairs of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“circle,”</span> of the superintendent, and
          of all the clergy of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“circle.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such were the
          beginnings of the consistorial system of Church government, which
          is a distinctive mark of the Lutheran Church, and which exhibits
          some of the individual traits of Luther's personality. We can see
          in it his desire to make full use of whatever portions of the
          mediæval Church usages could be pressed into the service of his
          evangelical Church; his conception that the one supreme authority
          on earth was that of the secular government; his suspicion of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“common”</span> man, and his resolve to
          prevent the people exercising any control over the arrangements of
          the Church.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gradually all
          the Lutheran Churches have adopted, in general outline at least,
          this consistorial system; but it would be a mistake to think that
          the Wittenberg <span class="tei tei-q">“use”</span> was adopted in
          all its details. Luther himself, as has been said, had no desire
          for anything like uniformity, and there was none in the beginning.
          All the schemes of ecclesiastical government proceed on the idea
          that the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">jus episcopale</span></span>
          or right of ecclesiastical oversight belongs to the supreme
          territorial secular authority. All of them <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> include within the one set of ordinances,
          provisions for the support of the ministry, for the maintenance of
          schools, and for the care of the poor—the last generally expressed
          by regulations about the <span class="tei tei-q">“common
          chest.”</span> The great variety of forms of ecclesiastical
          government drafted and adopted may be studied in Richter's
          collection, which includes one hundred and seventy-two separate
          ecclesiastical constitutions, and which is confessedly very
          imperfect. The gradual growth of the organisation finally adopted
          in each city and State can be traced for a portion of Germany in
          Sehling's unfinished work.<a id="noteref_382" name="noteref_382"
          href="#note_382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">382</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The number of
          these ecclesiastical ordinances is enormous, and the quantity is to
          be accounted for partly by the way in which Germany was split up
          into numerous small States in the sixteenth century, and also
          partly by the fact that Luther pled strongly for diversity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ordinances
          were promulgated in many different ways. Most frequently, perhaps,
          the prince published and enacted them on his own authority like any
          other piece of territorial legislation. Sometimes he commissioned a
          committee acting in his name to frame and publish. In other cases
          they resulted from a consultation between the prince and the
          magistrates of one of the towns within his dominions. Sometimes
          they came from the councils and the pastors of the towns to which
          they applied. In other instances they were issued by an evangelical
          bishop. And in a few cases they are simply the regulations issued
          by a single pastor for his own parish, which the secular
          authorities did not think of altering.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although they
          are independent one from another, they may be grouped in families
          which resemble each other closely.<a id="noteref_383" name=
          "noteref_383" href="#note_383"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">383</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the
          territories reached the consistorial system <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a name="Pg415" id="Pg415"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> much sooner than others. If a
          principality consisted in whole or in part of a secularised
          ecclesiastical State, the machinery of the consistorial court lay
          ready to the hand of the prince, and was at once adapted to the use
          of the evangelical Church. The system was naturally slowest to
          develop in the imperial cities, most of which at first preferred an
          organisation whose outlines were borrowed from the constitution
          drafted by Zwingli for Zurich.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once only do we
          find an attempt to give an evangelical Church occupying a large
          territory a democratic constitution. It was made by Philip,
          Landgrave of Hesse, who was never afraid of the democracy. No
          German prince had so thoroughly won the confidence of his
          commonalty. The Peasants' War never devastated his dominions. He
          did not join in the virulent persecution of the Anabaptists which
          disgraced the Lutheran as well as the Roman Catholic States during
          the latter half of the sixteenth century. It was natural that
          Luther's earlier ideas about the rights of the Christian community
          (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Gemeinde</span></span>) should appeal to him.
          In 1526 (Oct. 6th), when the Diet of Speyer had permitted the
          organisation of evangelical Churches, Philip summoned a Synod at
          Homberg, and invited not merely pastors and ecclesiastical lawyers,
          but representatives from the nobles and from the towns. A scheme
          for ecclesiastical government, which had been drafted by Francis
          Lambert, formerly a Franciscan monk, was laid before the assembly
          and adopted. It was based on the idea that the word of God is the
          only supreme rule to guide and govern His Church, and that Canon
          Law has no place whatsoever within an evangelical Church. Scripture
          teaches, the document explains, that it belongs to the Christian
          community itself to select and dismiss pastors and to exercise
          discipline by means of excommunication. The latter right ought to
          be used in a weekly meeting (on Sundays) of the congregation and
          pastor. For the purposes of orderly rule the Church must have
          office-bearers, who ought to conform as nearly as possible to those
          mentioned in the New Testament Scriptures. They are bishops
          (pastors), elders, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg
          416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          deacons; and the deacons are the guardians of the poor as well as
          ecclesiastical officials. All these office-bearers must remember
          that their function is that of servants, and in no sense lordly or
          magisterial. They ought to be chosen by the congregation, and set
          apart by the laying on of hands according to apostolic practice. A
          bishop (pastor) must be ordained by at least three pastors, and a
          deacon by the pastor or by two elders. The government of the whole
          Church ought to be in the hands of a Synod, to consist of all the
          pastors and a delegate from every parish. Such in outline was the
          democratic ecclesiastical government proposed for the territory of
          Hesse and accepted by the Landgrave.<a id="noteref_384" name=
          "noteref_384" href="#note_384"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a> He
          was persuaded, however, by Luther's strong remonstrances to abandon
          it. There is no place for the democratic or representative element
          in the organisation of the Lutheran Churches.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influence of
          Luther went far beyond Germany. It was felt in England, France,
          Scotland, Holland, Poland, and Scandinavia. England went her own
          peculiar way; France, Holland, and Scotland, in the end, accepted
          the leadership of Calvin; the Lutheran Reformation, outside
          Germany, was really confined to Scandinavia alone.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
          Scandinavian lands the religious awakening was bound up with
          political and social movements more than in any other countries.
          The reformation in the Church was, indeed, begun by men who had
          studied under Luther at Wittenberg, or who had received their first
          promptings from his writings; but it was carried on and brought to
          a successful issue by statesmen who saw in it the means to deliver
          their land from political anarchy, caused by the overweening
          independence and turbulence of the great ecclesiastical lords, and
          who were almost compelled to look to the large possessions of the
          Church as a means to replenish their exhausted treasuries without
          ruining the overburdened taxpayers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Eric was
          crowned King of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway in 1397, the assembled
          nobles, representative <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418">[pg
          418]</span><a name="Pg418" id="Pg418" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of the three kingdoms, agreed to the celebrated Union of Kalmar,
          which declared that the three lands were to be for ever united
          under one sovereign. The treaty was purely dynastic, its terms were
          vague, and it was never very effective. Without going into details,
          it may be said that the king lived in Denmark, and ruled in the
          interests of that country; that he also may be said to have ruled
          in Norway; but that in Sweden his authority was merely nominal, and
          sometimes not even that. In Denmark itself, monarchical government
          was difficult. The Scandinavian kingship was elective, and every
          election was an opportunity for reducing the privileges, authority,
          and wealth of the sovereign, and for increasing those of the nobles
          and of the great ecclesiastics, who, being privileged classes, were
          freed from contributing to the taxation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1513,
          Christian <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Elector of Saxony, and the brother-in-law of the Emperor Charles
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">v.</span></span> (1515), came to the
          throne, and his accession marks the beginning of the new era which
          was to end with the triumph of the Reformation in all three
          countries. Christian was a man of great natural abilities, with a
          profound sense of the miserable condition of the common people
          within his realms, caused by the petty tyrannies of the nobles,
          ecclesiastical and secular. No reigning prince, save perhaps
          George, Duke of Saxony, could compete with him in learning; but he
          was cruel, partly from nature and partly from policy. He had
          determined to establish his rule over the three kingdoms whose
          nominal king he was, and to free the commonalty from their
          oppression by breaking the power of the nobles and of the great
          Churchmen. The task was one of extreme difficulty, and he was
          personally unsuccessful; but his efforts laid the foundation on
          which successors were able to build securely.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He began by
          conquering rebellious Sweden, and disgraced his victory by a
          treacherous massacre of Swedish notables at Stockholm (1520),—a
          deed which, in the end, led to the complete separation of Sweden
          from Denmark. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg
          419]</span><a name="Pg419" id="Pg419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          After having thus, as he imagined, consolidated his power, he
          pressed forward his schemes for reform. He took pains to encourage
          the trade and agriculture of Denmark; he patronised learning. He
          wrote to his uncle (1519), Frederick, the Elector of Saxony, to
          send him preachers trained by Luther; and, in response to his
          appeal, received first Martin Reinhard, and then Andrew Bodenstein
          of Carlstadt. These foreigners, who could only address the people
          through interpreters, did not make much impression; but reformation
          was pushed forward by the king. He published, on his own authority,
          two sets of laws dealing with the nobles and the Church, and
          subjecting both to the sovereign. He enacted that all convents were
          to be under episcopal inspection. Non-resident and unlettered
          clergy were legally abolished. A species of kingly consistorial
          court was set up in Copenhagen, and declared to be the supreme
          ecclesiastical judicature for the country; and appeals to Rome were
          forbidden. It can scarcely be said that these laws were ever in
          operation. A revolt by the Jutlanders gave a rallying point to the
          disaffection caused by the proposed reforms. Christian fled from
          Denmark (1523), and spent the rest of his life in exile or in
          prison. His law-books were burnt.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Jutlanders
          had called Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein, Christian's uncle, to
          the throne, and he was recognised King of Denmark and of Norway in
          1523. He had come to the kingdom owing to the reaction against the
          reforms of his nephew, but in his heart he knew that they were
          necessary. He promised to protect the interests of the nobles, and
          to defend the Church against the advance of Lutheran opinions; but
          he soon endeavoured to find a means of evading his pledges. He
          found it when he pitted the nobles against the higher clergy, and
          announced that he had never promised to support the errors of the
          Church of Rome. At the National Assembly (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Herredag</span></span>) at Odense he was able
          to get the marriage of priests permitted, and a decree that bishops
          were in the future to apply to the king and not to the Pope for
          their Pallium. The Reformation <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page420">[pg 420]</span><a name="Pg420" id="Pg420" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> had now native preachers to support it,
          especially Hans Tausen, who was called the Danish Luther, and they
          were encouraged by the king. At the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Herredag</span></span> at Copenhagen in 1530,
          twenty-one of these Lutheran preachers were summoned, at the
          instigation of the bishops, and formal accusations were made
          against them for preaching heresy. Tausen and his fellows produced
          a confession of faith in forty-three articles, all of which he and
          his companions offered to defend. A public disputation was
          proposed, which did not take place because the Romanist party
          refused to plead in the Danish language. This refusal was
          interpreted by the people to mean that they were afraid to discuss
          in a language which everyone understood. Lutheranism made rapid
          progress among all classes of the population.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Frederick's
          death there was a disputed succession, which resulted in civil war.
          In the end Frederick's son ascended the throne as Christian
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">iii.</span></span>, King of Denmark and
          Norway (1536). The king, who had been present at the Diet of Worms,
          and who had learned there to esteem Luther highly, was a strong
          Lutheran, and determined to end the authority of the Romish
          bishops. He proposed to his council that bishops should no longer
          have any share in the government, and that their possessions should
          be forfeited to the Crown. This was approved of not merely by the
          council, but also at a National Assembly which met at Copenhagen
          (Oct. 30th, 1536), where it was further declared that the people
          desired the holy gospel to be preached, and the whole episcopal
          authority done away with. The king asked Luther to send him some
          one to guide his people in their ecclesiastical matters. Bugenhagen
          was despatched, came to Copenhagen (1537), and took the chief
          ecclesiastical part in crowning the king. Seven superintendents
          (who afterwards took the title of bishops) were appointed and
          consecrated. The Reformation was carried out on conservative
          Lutheran lines, and the old ritual was largely preserved. Tausen's
          Confession was set aside in favour of the Augsburg Confession and
          Luther's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page421">[pg
          421]</span><a name="Pg421" id="Pg421" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Small Catechism, and the Lutheran Reformation was thoroughly and
          legally established.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Reformation
          also became an accomplished fact in Norway and Iceland, but its
          introduction into these lands was much more an act of kingly
          authority.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the
          massacre of Swedish notables in Stockholm (Nov. 1520), young Gustaf
          Ericsson, commonly known as Gustaf Vasa, from the <span lang="sv"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sv"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">vasa</span></span> or sheaf which was on his
          coat of arms, raised the standard of revolt against Denmark. He was
          gradually able to rally the whole of the people around him, and the
          Danes were expelled from the kingdom. In 1521, Gustaf had been
          declared regent of Sweden, and in 1523 he was called by the voice
          of the people to the throne. He found himself surrounded by almost
          insuperable difficulties. There had been practically no settled
          government in Sweden for nearly a century, and every great
          landholder was virtually an independent sovereign. The country had
          been impoverished by long wars. Two-thirds of the land was owned by
          the Church, and the remaining third was almost entirely in the
          hands of the secular nobles. Both Church and nobles claimed
          exemption from taxation. The trade of the country was in the hands
          of foreigners—of the Danes or of the Hanse Towns. Gustaf had
          borrowed money from the town of Lübeck for his work of liberation.
          The city was pressing for repayment, and its commissioners followed
          the embarrassed monarch wherever he went. It was hopeless to expect
          to raise money by further taxation of the already depressed and
          impoverished peasants.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
          circumstances the king turned to the Church. He compelled the
          bishops to give him more than one subsidy (1522, 1523); but this
          was inadequate for his needs. The Church property was large, and
          the king planned to overthrow the ecclesiastical aristocracy by the
          help of the Lutheran Reformation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lutheranism had
          been making progress in Sweden. Two brothers, Olaus and Laurentius
          Petri, sons of a blacksmith at Orebro, had been sent by their
          father to study <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page422">[pg
          422]</span><a name="Pg422" id="Pg422" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          in Germany. They had meant to attend the University of Leipzig;
          but, attracted by the growing fame of Luther, they had gone to
          Wittenberg, and had become enthusiastic disciples of the Reformer.
          On their return to Sweden (1519) they had preached Lutheran
          doctrine, and had made many converts—among others, Laurentius
          Andreæ, Archdeacon at Strengnäs. In spite of protests from the
          bishops, these three men were protected by the king. Olaus Petri
          was especially active, and made long preaching tours, declaring
          that he taught the pure gospel which <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ansgar, the apostle of the North, had preached seven
          hundred years before in Sweden.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gustaf brought
          Olaus to Stockholm (1524), and made him town-clerk of the city; his
          brother Laurentius was appointed professor of theology at Upsala;
          Laurentius Andrew was made Archdeacon of Upsala and Chancellor of
          Sweden. When the bishops demanded that the Reformers should be
          silenced, Olaus challenged them to a public disputation. The
          challenge was refused; but in 1524 a disputation was arranged in
          the king's palace in Stockholm between Olaus and Dr. Galle, who
          supported the old religion. The conference, which included
          discussion of the doctrines of Justification by Faith, Indulgences,
          the Mass, Purgatory, and the Temporal Power of the Pope, had the
          effect of strengthening the cause of the Reformation. In 1525,
          Olaus defied the rules of the mediæval Church by publicly marrying
          a wife. The same year the king called for a translation of the
          Scriptures into Swedish, and in 1526 Laurentius Petri published his
          New Testament. A translation of the whole Bible was edited by the
          same scholar, and published 1540-1541. These translations,
          especially that of the New Testament, became very popular, and the
          people with the Scripture in their hands were able to see whether
          the teaching of the preachers or of the bishops was most in
          accordance with the Holy Scriptures.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no
          reason to believe that the king did not take the side of the
          Lutheran Reformation from genuine <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page423">[pg 423]</span><a name="Pg423" id="Pg423" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> conviction. He had made the acquaintance of
          the brothers Petri before he was called to be the deliverer of his
          country. But it is unquestionable that his financial embarrassment
          whetted his zeal for the reformation of the Church in Sweden.
          Matters were coming to a crisis, which was reached in 1527. At the
          Diet in that year, the Chancellor, in the name of the king,
          explained the need for an increased revenue, and suggested that
          ecclesiastical property was the only source from which it could be
          obtained. The bishops, Johan Brask, Bishop of Linkoeping, at their
          head, replied that they had the Pope's orders to defend the
          property of the Church. The nobles supported them. Then Gustaf
          presented his ultimatum. He told the Diet plainly that they must
          submit to the proposals of the Chancellor or accept his
          resignation, pay him for his property, return him the money he had
          spent in defence of the kingdom, and permit him to leave the
          country never to return. The Diet spent three days in wrangling,
          and then submitted to his wishes. The whole of the ecclesiastical
          property—episcopal, capitular, and monastic—which was not
          absolutely needed for the support of the Church was to be placed in
          the hands of the king. Preachers were meanwhile to set forth the
          pure gospel, until a conference held in presence of the Diet would
          enable that assembly to come to a decision concerning matters of
          religion. The Diet went on, without waiting for the conference, to
          pass the twenty-four regulations which made the famous Ordinances
          of Vesteräs, and embodied the legal Reformation. They contained
          provisions for secularising the ecclesiastical property in
          accordance with the previous decision of the Diet; declared that
          the king had the right of vetoing the decisions of the higher
          ecclesiastics; that the appointment of the parish clergy was in the
          hands of the bishops, but that the king could remove them for
          inefficiency; that the pure gospel was to be taught in every
          school; and that auricular confession was no longer compulsory.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
          Ordinances stripped the Swedish Church of a large amount of its
          property and made it subject to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page424">[pg 424]</span><a name="Pg424" id="Pg424" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> king, they did not destroy its episcopal
          organisation, nor entirely impoverish it. Most of the monasteries
          were deserted when their property was taken away. The king knew
          that the peasantry scarcely understood the Reformed doctrines, and
          had no wish to press them unduly on his people. For the same reason
          the old ceremonies and usages which did not flagrantly contradict
          the new doctrines were suffered to remain, and given an evangelical
          meaning. The first evangelical Hymn-book was published in 1530, and
          the Swedish <span class="tei tei-q">“Mass”</span> in 1531, both
          drafted on Lutheran models. Laurentius Andreæ was made Archbishop
          of Upsala (1527), and a National Synod was held under his
          presidency at Orebro (1528), which guided the Reformation according
          to strictly conservative Lutheran ideals. Thus before the death of
          Gustaf Vasa, Sweden had joined the circle of Lutheran Churches, and
          its people were slowly coming to understand the principles of the
          Reformation. The Reformation was a very peaceful one. No one
          suffered death for his religious opinions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fortunes of
          the Swedish Church were somewhat varied under the immediate
          successors of Gustavus. His ill-fated son showed signs of
          preferring Calvinism, and insisted on the suppression of some of
          the ecclesiastical festivals and some of the old rites which had
          been retained; but these attempts ended with his reign. His brother
          and successor, Johan <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">iii.</span></span>, took the opposite
          extreme, and coquetted long with Rome, and with proposals for
          reunion,—proposals which had no serious result. When Johan died in
          1592, his son and successor, who had been elected King of Poland,
          and had become a Roman Catholic, aroused the fears of his Swedish
          subjects that he might go much further than his father. The people
          resolved to make sure of their Protestantism before their new
          sovereign arrived in the country. A Synod was convened at which
          both lay and ecclesiastical deputies were present. The members
          first laid down the general rule that the Holy Scriptures were
          their supreme doctrinal standard, and then selected the Augsburg
          Confession as the Confession of the Swedish <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg 425]</span><a name="Pg425" id="Pg425"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Church. Luther's Small Catechism, which
          had been removed from the schools by King Johan <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">iii.</span></span>, was restored. This
          meeting at Upsala settled for the future the ecclesiastical polity
          of Sweden. The country showed its attachment to the stricter
          Lutheranism by adopting the Formula of Concord in 1664.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whole of
            Luther's religious history, from his entrance into the convent at
            Erfurt to the publication of the Augsburg Confession, shows that
            the movement of which he was the soul and centre did not arise
            from any merely intellectual criticism of the doctrines of the
            mediæval church, and that it resulted in a great deal more than a
            revision or reconstruction of a system of doctrinal
            conceptions.<a id="noteref_387" name="noteref_387" href=

            There is no trace of any intellectual difficulties about
            doctrines or statement of doctrines in Luther's mind during the
            supreme crisis of his history. He was driven out of the world of
            human life and hope, where he was well fitted to do a man's work,
            by the overwhelming pressure of a great practical religious
            need—anxiety to save his soul. He has himself said that the
            proverb that doubt makes a monk was true in his case. He doubted
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a name=
            "Pg427" id="Pg427" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> whether he could
            save his soul in the world, and was therefore forced to leave it
            and enter the convent.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had lost
            whatever evangelical teaching he had learnt in childhood or in
            Frau Cotta's household at Eisenach. He had surrendered himself to
            the popular belief, fostered by the whole penitential system of
            the mediæval Church, that man could and must make himself fit to
            receive the grace of God which procures salvation. The
            self-torturing cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, when wilt thou
            become holy and fit to obtain the grace of God?”</span>
            (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">O wenn will tu einmal fromm
            werden und genug thun du einen gnädigen Gott
            kriegest?</span></span>), drove him into the convent. He
            believed, and the almost unanimous opinion of his age agreed with
            him, that there, if anywhere, he could find the peace he was
            seeking with such desperation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Inside the
            convent he applied himself with all the force of a strong nature,
            using every means that the complicated penitential system of the
            Church had provided to help him, to make himself pious and fit to
            be the receptacle of the grace of God. He submitted to the orders
            of his superiors with the blind obedience which the most rigorous
            ecclesiastical statutes demanded; he sought the comforting
            consolations which confession was declared to give; he underwent
            every part of the complex system of expiations which the mediæval
            Church recommended; he made full use of the sacraments, and
            waited in vain for the mysterious, inexplicable experience of the
            grace which was said to accompany and flow from them. He
            persevered in spite of the feeling of continuous failure.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“If a monk ever reached heaven by
            monkery,”</span> he has said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I would

            gave a still stronger proof of his loyalty to the mediæval Church
            and its advice to men in his mood of mind; he persevered in spite
            of the knowledge that his comrades and his religious superiors
            believed him to be a young saint, while he knew that he was far
            otherwise, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg

            and that he was no nearer God than he had been before he entered
            the monastery, or had begun his quest after the sense of pardon
            of sin. The contrast between what his brethren thought he must be
            and what his own experience told him that he was, must have added
            bitterness to the cup he had to drink during these terrible
            months in the Erfurt convent. He says himself:</p>

            child coming pure from baptism. Assuredly, I would willingly have
            delighted in the glorious fact that I was such a good man, who by
            his own deeds and without the merits of Christ's blood had made
            himself so fair and holy, and so easily too, and in so short a
            time. But although I listened readily to the sweet praise and
            glowing language about myself and my doings, and allowed myself
            to be described as a wonder-worker, who could make himself holy
            in such an easy way, and could swallow up death, and the devil
            also, yet there was no power in it all to maintain me. When even
            a small temptation came from sin or death I fell at once, and
            found that neither baptism nor monkery could assist me; I felt
            that I had long lost Christ and His baptism. I was the most
            miserable man on earth; day and night there was only wailing and

            two years of anguish, Luther believed that he was battling with
            himself and with his sin; he was really struggling with the
            religion of his times and Church. He was probing it, testing it,
            examining all its depths, wrestling with all its means of grace,
            and finding that what were meant to be sources of comfort and
            consolation were simply additional springs of terror. He was too
            clear-sighted, his spiritual senses were too acute, he was too
            much in deadly earnest, not to see that none of these aids were
            leading him to a solid ground of certainty on <span class=

            for time and for eternity; and he was too honest with himself to
            be persuaded that he was otherwise than his despair told

            the righteousness of God (Rom. i. 17) is not the righteousness by

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The faith
            which he prized is that religious faculty which <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“throws itself upon God”</span>; and from the first
            Luther recognised that faith of this kind was a direct gift from
            God. Having it we have everything; without it we have nothing.
            Here we find something entirely new, or at least hitherto
            unexpressed, so far as mediæval theology was concerned. Mediæval
            theologians had recognised faith in the sense of what Luther
            called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">frigida
            opinio</span></span>, and it is difficult to conceive that they
            did not also indirectly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg

            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">fiducia</span></span>; but
            faith with them was simply one among many human efforts all
            equally necessary in order to see and know God. Luther recognised
            that there was this kind of faith, which a man begets and brings
            to pass in himself by assent to doctrines of some sort. But he
            did not think much of it. He calls it worthless because it gives
            us nothing.</p>

            that faith is a thing which they may have or not have at will,
            like any other natural human thing; so when they arrive at a

            Now, when they see and feel that no change has been wrought in
            themselves and in others, and that works do not follow, and they
            remain as before in the old nature, then they think that the
            faith is not good enough, but that there must be something more
            and greater.</span><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The real
            faith, the faith which is trust, the divine gift which impels us
            to throw ourselves upon God, gives us the living assurance of a
            living God, who has revealed Himself, made us see His loving
            Fatherly heart in Christ Jesus; and that is the Christian
            religion in its very core and centre. The sum of Christianity
            is—(1) God manifest in Christ, the God of grace, accessible by
            every Christian man and woman; and (2) unwavering trust in Him
            who has given Himself to us in Christ Jesus,—unwavering, because
            Christ with His work has undertaken our cause and made it
            His.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The God we
            have access to and Whom we can trust because we have thrown
            ourselves upon Him and have found that He sustains us, is no
            philosophical abstraction, to be described in definitions and
            argued about in syllogisms. He is seen and known, because we see
            and know Christ Jesus. <span class="tei tei-q">“He that hath seen
            Me hath seen the Father.”</span> For with Luther and all the
            Reformers, Christ fills the whole sphere of God; and they do not
            recognise any theology which is not a
            Christology.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The faith
            which makes us throw ourselves upon God is no mood of mere
            mystical abandonment. It is our very life, as Luther was never
            tired of saying. It is God within us, and wells forth in all
            kinds of activities.</p>

            works are to be done; it has done them before there is time to
            ask the question, and it is always doing
              them.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Christianity
            is therefore an interwoven tissue of promises and prayers of
            faith. On the one side there is the Father, revealing Himself,
            sending down to us His promises which are yea and amen in Christ
            Jesus; and on the other side there are the hearts of men
            ascending in faith to God, receiving, accepting, and resting on
            the promises of God, and on God who always gives Himself in His
            promises.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is what
            came to Luther and ended his long and terrible struggle. He is
            unwearied in describing it. The descriptions are very varied, so
            far as external form and expression go,—now texts from the
            Psalms, the Prophets, or the New Testament most aptly quoted; now
            phrases borrowed from the picturesque language of the mediæval
            mystics; now sentences of striking, even rugged, originality;
            sometimes propositions taken from the mediæval scholastic. But
            whatever the words, the meaning is always the same.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
            conception of what is meant by Christianity is the religious soul
            of the Reformation. It contains within it all the distinctively
            religious principles which inspired it. It can scarcely be called
            a dogma. It is an experience, and the phrases which set it forth
            are the descriptions of an experience which a human soul has gone
            through. The thing itself is beyond exact definition—as all deep
            experiences are. It must be felt and gone through to be known.
            The Reformation started from this personal <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span><a name="Pg432" id=
            "Pg432" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> experience of the believing
            Christian, which it declared to be the one elemental fact in
            Christianity which could never be proved by argument and could
            never be dissolved away by speculation. It proclaimed the great
            truth, which had been universally neglected throughout the whole
            period of mediæval theology by everyone except the Mystics, that
            in order to know God man must be in living touch with God
            Himself. Therein lay its originality and its power. Luther
            rediscovered religion when he declared that the truly Christian
            man must cling directly and with a living faith to the God Who
            speaks to him in Christ, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
            thy salvation.”</span> The earlier Reformers never forgot this.
            Luther proclaimed his discovery, he never attempted to prove it
            by argument; it was something self-evident—seen and known when
            experienced.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is always
            the way with great religious pioneers and leaders. They have all
            had the prophetic gift of spiritual vision, and the magnetic
            speech to proclaim what they have seen, felt, and known. They
            have all had, in a far-off way, the insight and manner of
            Jesus.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When our Lord
            appeared among men claiming to be more than a wise man or a
            prophet, declaring that He was the Messiah, the Son of Man and
            the Son of God, when He announced that all men had need of Him,
            and that He alone could save and redeem, He set forth His claims
            in a manner unique among founders of religions. He made them
            calmly and as a matter of course. He never explained elaborately
            why He assumed the titles He took. He never reasoned about His
            position as the only Saviour. He simply announced it, letting the
            conviction of the truth steal almost insensibly into the minds
            and hearts of His followers as they saw His deeds and heard His
            words. He assumed that they must interpret His death in one way
            only. This was always His manner. It was not His way to explain
            mysteries our curiosity would fain penetrate. He quietly took for
            granted many things we would like to argue about. His sayings
            came from One who lived in perpetual communion with the Unseen
            Father, and He uttered them <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page433">[pg 433]</span><a name="Pg433" id="Pg433" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> quietly and assuredly, confident that they
            carried with them their own self-evidencing power.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So it was with
            St. Paul. His letters and sermons are full of arguments, no
            doubt, full of pleadings and persuasion, but they all start from
            and rest upon his vision of the living, risen Saviour. His last
            word is always, <span class="tei tei-q">“When it pleased God to
            reveal His Son in me”</span>; that was the elemental fact which
            he proclaimed and which summed up everything, the personal
            experience from which he started on his career as an apostle. The
            place of Athanasius as a great religious leader has been obscured
            by his position as a theologian; but when we turn to his
            writings, where do we find less of what is commonly called
            dogmatic theology? There is argument, reasoning, searching for
            proofs and their statement; but all that belongs to the outworks
            in his teaching. The central citadel is a spiritual intuition—I
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">know</span></em> that <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></em>
            Saviour is the God Who made heaven and earth. He took his stand
            firmly and unflinchingly on that personal experience, and all
            else mattered little compared with the fundamental spiritual

            convinced his generation.</p>

            Francis—so it has been with every great religious leader of the
            Christian people. His strength, whether of knowledge, or
            conviction, or sympathy,—his driving power, if the phrase may be
            used,—has always come from direct communion with the unseen, and
            rests upon the fact, felt and known by himself and communicated
            to others by a mysterious sympathy, that it has pleased God to
            reveal Christ in him in some way or other.</p><span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So it was with
            Luther and the Reformation in which he was the leader. Its
            driving power was a great religious experience, old, for it has
            come to the people of God in all generations, and yet new and
            fresh as it is the nature of all such experiences to be. He
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">knew</span></em> that his life was hid with
            Christ in God in spite of all evil, in spite of sin and sense of
            guilt. His old dread of God had vanished, and instead of it there
            had arisen in his heart a love to God in answer to the love which
            came from the vision of the Father revealing Himself. He had
            experienced this, and he had proclaimed what he had gone through;
            and the experience and its proclamation were the foundation on
            which the Reformation was built. Its beginnings were not
            doctrinal but experimental.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Doctrines,
            indeed, are not the beginnings of things; they are, at the best,
            storehouses of past and blessed experiences. This is true of most
            knowledge in all departments of research. We may recognise that
            there is some practical use in the rules of logic, ancient and
            modern, but we know that they are but the uncouth and inadequate
            symbols of the ways in which an indefinable mental tact, whose
            delicacy varies with the mind that uses it, perceives divergences
            and affinities, and weaves its web of knowledge in ways that are
            past finding out. We know that logical argument is a good shield
            but a bad sword, and that while syllogisms may silence, they
            seldom convince; that persuasion arises from a subtle sympathy of
            soul with soul, which is as indefinable as the personalities
            which exhale it. There is always at the basis of knowledge of men
            and things this delicate contact of personality with personality,
            whether we think of the gathering, or assorting, or exchanging
            the wisdom we possess. If this be true of our knowledge of common
            things, it is overwhelmingly so of all knowledge of God and of
            things divine. We must be in touch with God to know Him in the
            true sense of knowledge. At the basis of every real advance in
            religion there must be an intimate vision of God impressed upon
            us as a religious experience which we know to be true because we
            have felt <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg
            435]</span><a name="Pg435" id="Pg435" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            it; and what one has, another receives by a species of spiritual
            contagion. The revival under Francis of Assisi spread as it did
            because the fire flaming in the heart of the preacher was also
            kindled in the hearts of his hearers. Luther headed a Reformation
            because men felt and knew that he had, as he said, found a
            gracious God by trusting in the grace of God revealed to him in
            Christ Jesus. It was not the Augsburg Confession that made the
            Reformation; it was the expansion of that religious experience
            which finds very inadequate description in that or in any other
            statement of doctrines.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther's
            religious experience, that he, a sinner, received forgiveness by
            simply throwing himself on God revealed in Christ Jesus the
            Saviour, came to him as an astounding revelation which was almost
            too great to be put into words. He tried to express it in varying
            ways, all of which he felt too utterly inadequate to describe it.
            We can see how he laboured at it from 1512 to 1517. It lay hidden
            in his discourse to the assembly of clergy in the episcopal
            palace at Ziesar (June 5th, 1512), when he declared that all
            reform must begin in the hearts of individual men. We can see it
            growing more and more articulate in his annotations, notes, and
            heads of lectures on the Psalms, delivered in the years
            1513-1516, struggling to free itself from the phrases of the
            Scholastic Theology which could not really express it. His
            private letters, in which he was less hampered by the phraseology
            which he still believed appropriate to theology, are full of
            happier expressions.<a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href=

            manifests itself in the remission of sins; it is the truth of God
            seen in the fulfilment of His promises in the historical work of
            Christ; Jesus Christ Himself is grace, is the way, is life and
            salvation. Faith is trust in the truth of God as manifested in
            the life and work of Jesus Christ; it is to believe in God; it is
            a knowledge of the Cross of Christ; it is to understand that the
            Son of God became incarnate, was crucified, and raised again for
            our salvation. The three central thoughts—<em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">justification</span></em>, <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">grace</span></em>, <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">faith</span></em>—expressed in these
            inadequate phrases, are always looked upon and used to regulate
            that estimate of ourselves which forms the basis of piety. It is
            needless to trace the growing adequacy of the description. Luther
            at last found words to say that the central thought in
            Christianity is that the believer in possession of faith, which
            is itself the gift of God, is able to throw himself on God in
            Christ Who is his salvation and Who has mirrored Himself for us
            in Christ Jesus. He had trod the weary round that Augustine had
            gone before him; he had tried <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to help
            himself</span></em> in every possible way; he had found that with
            all his striving he could do nothing. Then, strange and
            mysterious as it was, the discovery had not brought despair, but
            rejoicing and comfort; for since there was no help whatever in
            man, his soul had been forced to find <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">all</span></em>—not part, but all—help in
            God. When he was able to express his experience he could say that
            the faith which throws itself on God, which is God's own gift, is
            the certainty of the forgiveness of sins. It was no adherence to
            doctrines more or less clearly comprehended; it was no act of
            initiation to be followed by a nearer approach to God and a
            larger measure of His grace; it was the power which gives life,
            certainty, peace, continuous self-surrender to God as the Father,
            and which transforms and renews the whole man. It was the life of
            the soul; it was Christianity within the believer—as Jesus Christ
            and His work is Christianity outside the believer.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is manifest
            that as soon as this experience attained <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page437">[pg 437]</span><a name="Pg437" id="Pg437" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> articulate statement, it was bound to
            discredit much that was in mediæval theology and religious usage.
            Yet the striking thing about Luther was that he never sought to
            employ it in this way until one great abuse forced itself upon
            him and compelled him to test it by this touchstone of what true
            Christianity was. This reserve not only shows that there was
            nothing revolutionary in the character of Luther, nothing
            romantic or quixotic, it also manifests the quiet greatness of
            the man. Nor was there anything in the fundamental religious
            experience of Luther which necessarily conflicted with the
            contents of the old ecclesiastical doctrines, or even with the
            common usages of the religious life. There was a change in the
            attitude towards both, and an entirely new estimate of their
            religious value, but nothing which called for their immediate
            criticism, still less for their destruction. Faith, which was the
            Christian life, could no longer be based upon them; they were not
            the essential things that they had been supposed to be; but they
            might have their uses if kept in their proper places—aids to all
            holy living, but not that from which the life sprang. The thought
            that the entire sum of religion consists in <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“unwavering trust of the heart in Him Who has given
            Himself to us in Christ as our Father, personal assurance of
            faith, because Christ with His work undertakes our cause,”</span>
            simplified religion marvellously, and made many things which had
            been regarded as essential mere outside auxiliaries. But it did
            not necessarily sweep them away. Though the acceptance of certain
            forms of doctrine, auricular confession, the monastic life,
            communion by the laity in one <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“kind”</span> only in the Sacrament of the Supper, a
            celibate priesthood, fasting, going on pilgrimages, not to eat
            meat on Friday, had nothing to do with the essentials of the
            Christian life; still it was not necessary to insist on eating
            meat on Friday, on abstaining from fasting, and so on. The great
            matter was the spirit in which such things were performed or left
            undone. What the fundamental religious experience had done was to
            show the liberty of the Christian man to trust courageously in
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg 438]</span><a name=
            "Pg438" id="Pg438" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> God and count all
            things of little moment compared with this which was the one
            thing needful.</p>

            work, his whole being obtained stability and firmness, nay, even

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">God Himself
            gave the believer the power to throw himself directly on God. But
            this contradicted one of the most widely diffused and most
            strongly held religious beliefs of the mediæval Church, and was
            bound to come in collision with it whenever the two were
            confronted with each other. It was the universal conception of
            mediæval piety that the mediation of a priest was essential to
            salvation. Mediæval Christians believed with more or less
            distinctness that the supernatural life of the soul was
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">created</span></em>, nourished, and
            perfected through the sacraments, and that the priests
            administering them possessed, in virtue of their ordination,
            miraculous powers whereby they daily offered the true sacrifice
            of Jesus Christ upon the altar, forgave the sins of men, and
            taught the truths of salvation with divine authority. It was this
            universally accepted power of a mediatorial priesthood which had
            enslaved Europe, and which had rendered the liberty of a
            Christian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg
            439]</span><a name="Pg439" id="Pg439" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            man an impossible thing. Everywhere the priesthood barred, or was
            supposed to be able to bar, the way to God. The Church, which
            ought to have shown how God Who had revealed Himself in Christ
            was accessible to every believer, had surrounded the inner shrine
            of the sanctuary of His Presence with a triple wall of defence
            which prevented entrance. When man or woman felt sorrow for sin,
            they were instructed to go, not to God, but to a man, often of
            immoral life, and confess their sins to him because he was a
            priest. When they wished to hear the comforting words of pardon
            spoken, it was not from God, but from a priest that the assurance
            was supposed to come. God's grace, to help to holy living and to
            bring comfort in dying, was given, it was said, only through a
            series of sacraments which fenced man's life round, and priests
            could give or withhold these sacraments. Man was born again in
            baptism; he came of age spiritually in confirmation; his marriage
            was cleansed from the sin of lust in the sacrament of matrimony;
            penance brought back his spiritual life slain by deadly sin; the
            Eucharist gave him with his voyage victual as he journeyed
            through life; and deathbed grace was imparted in extreme unction.
            These ceremonies were not the signs and promises of the free
            grace of God, under whose wide canopy, as under that of heaven,
            man lived his spiritual life. They were jealously guarded doors
            from out of which grudgingly, and commonly not without fees, the
            priests dispensed the free grace of God.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the
            later Middle Ages a gross abuse made the evils of this conception
            of a mediating priesthood emphatic. The practical evil lying in
            the whole thought was not so very apparent when the matter was
            regarded from the side of giving out the grace of God; but when
            it came to withholding it, then it was seen what the whole
            conception meant. The Bishops of Rome gave the peoples of Europe
            many an object lesson on this. If a town, or a district, or a
            whole country had offended the Pope and the Curia, it was placed
            under an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">interdict</span></em>, and the priests were
            commanded to refuse the sacraments to the people. They
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg 440]</span><a name=
            "Pg440" id="Pg440" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> stood between the
            newborn babe and the initial grace supposed to be bestowed in
            baptism, and to be absolutely withheld if baptism was not
            administered; between the dying man and the deathbed grace which
            was received in extreme unction; between young men and women and
            legal marriage blessed by God; between the people and daily
            worship and the bestowal of grace in the Eucharist. The God of
            grace could not be approached, the blessings of pardon and
            strength for holy living could not be procured, because the
            magistrates of a town or the king and councillors of a nation had
            offended the Bishop of Rome on an affair of worldly policy. The
            Church, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the clergy, who were by
            the theory enabled to refuse to communicate the grace of God,
            barred all access to the God who had revealed Himself in Christ
            Jesus. The Pope by a stroke of the pen could prevent a whole
            nation, so it was believed, from approaching God, because he
            could prohibit priests from performing the usual sacramental acts
            which alone brought Him near. An <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">interdict</span></em> meant spiritual death
            to the district on which it fell, and on the mediæval theory it
            was more deadly to the spiritual life than the worst of plagues,
            the Black Death itself, was to the body. An <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">interdict</span></em> made the plainest
            intellect see, understand, and shudder at the awful and
            mysterious powers which a mediatorial priesthood was said to
            possess.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            fundamental religious experience of Luther had made him know that
            the Father, who has revealed Himself in His Son, is accessible to
            every humble penitent and faithful seeker after God. He
            proclaimed aloud the spiritual priesthood of all believers. He
            stated it with his usual graphic emphasis in that tract of his,
            which he always said contained the marrow of his
            message—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Concerning Christian Liberty</span></span>.
            He begins by an antithesis: <span class="tei tei-q">“A Christian
            man is the most free lord of all, and subject to none: a
            Christian man is the most dutiful servant of all, and subject to
            everyone”</span>; or, as St. Paul puts it, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Though I be free from all men, yet have I made
            myself servant of all.”</span> He expounds this by showing that
            no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg 441]</span><a name=
            "Pg441" id="Pg441" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> outward things
            have any influence in producing Christian righteousness or
            liberty; neither eating, drinking, nor anything of the kind,
            neither hunger nor thirst have to do with the liberty or the
            slavery of the soul. It does not profit the soul to wear sacred
            vestments or to dwell in sacred places; nor does it harm the soul
            to be clothed in worldly raiment, and to eat and drink in the
            ordinary fashion. The soul can do without everything except the
            word of God, and this word of God is the gospel of God concerning
            His Son, incarnate, suffering, risen, and glorified through the
            Spirit the Sanctifier. <span class="tei tei-q">“To preach Christ
            is to feed the soul, to justify it, to set it free, to save it,
            if it believes the preaching; for faith alone and the efficacious
            use of the word of God bring salvation.”</span> It is faith that
            incorporates Christ with the believer, and in this way
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the soul through faith alone, without
            works, is, from the word of God, justified, sanctified, endued
            with truth, peace, liberty, and filled full with every good
            thing, and is truly made the child of God.”</span> For faith
            brings the soul and the word together, and the soul is acted upon
            by the word, as iron exposed to fire glows like fire because of
            its union with the fire. Faith honours and reveres Him in Whom it
            trusts, and cleaves to His promises, never doubting but that He
            overrules all for the best. Faith unites the soul to Christ, so
            that <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ and the soul become one
            flesh.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus the believing soul,
            by the pledge of its faith in Christ, becomes free from all sin,
            fearless of death, safe from hell, and endowed with the eternal
            righteousness, life, and salvation of its husband Christ.”</span>
            This gives the liberty of the Christian man; no dangers can
            really harm him, no sorrows utterly overwhelm him: for he is
            always accompanied by the Christ to whom he is united by his
            faith.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Here you will ask,”</span> says Luther, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘If all who are in the
            Church are priests, by what character are those whom we now call
            priests to be distinguished from the laity?’</span> I reply, By
            the use of these words <span class="tei tei-q">‘priest,’</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘clergy,’</span> <span class=

            "tei tei-q">‘ecclesiastic,’</span> an injustice has been done,
            since they have been transferred from the remaining body
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page442">[pg 442]</span><a name=
            "Pg442" id="Pg442" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Christians to
            those few who are now, by a hurtful custom, called ecclesiastics.
            For Holy Scripture makes no distinction between them, except that
            those who are now boastfully called Popes, bishops, and lords, it
            calls ministers, servants, and stewards, who are to serve the
            rest in the ministry of the word, for teaching the faith of
            Christ and the liberty of believers. For though it is true that
            we are all equally priests, yet we cannot, nor ought we if we
            could, all to minister and teach publicly.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first part
            of the treatise shows that everything which a Christian man has
            goes back in the end to his faith; if he has this he has all; if
            he has it not, nothing else suffices him. In the same way the
            second part shows that everything that a Christian man does must
            come from his faith. It may be necessary to fast and keep the
            body under; it will be necessary to make use of all the
            ceremonies of divine service which have been found effectual for
            the spiritual education of man. The thing to remember is that
            these are not good works in themselves in the sense of making a
            man good; they are all rather the signs of his faith, and are to
            be done with joy, because they are done to the God to whom faith
            unites us. So ecclesiastical ceremonies, or what may be called
            the machinery of Church life, are valuable, and indeed
            indispensable to the life of the soul, provided only they are
            regarded in the proper way and kept in their proper place; but
            they may become harmful and most destructive of the true
            religious life if they are considered in any other light than
            that of means to an end. <span class="tei tei-q">“We do not
            condemn works,”</span> says Luther, <span class="tei tei-q">“nay
            we attach the highest value to them. We only condemn that opinion
            of works which regards them as constituting true
            righteousness.”</span> They are, he explains, like the
            scaffolding of a building, eminently useful so long as they
            assist the builder; harmful if they obstruct; and at the best of
            temporary value. They are destructive to the spiritual life when
            they come between the soul and God. It follows, therefore, that
            if through human corruption and neglect of the plain precepts
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page443">[pg 443]</span><a name=
            "Pg443" id="Pg443" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the word of God
            these ecclesiastical usages hinder instead of aid the true growth
            of the soul, they ought to be changed or done away with; and the
            fact that the soul of man, in the last resort, needs absolutely
            nothing but the word of God dwelling within it, gives men courage
            and tranquillity in demanding their reformation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the same
            way fellow-men are not to be allowed to come between God and the
            human soul; and there is no need that they should. So far as
            spiritual position and privileges go, the laity are on the very
            same level as the clergy, for laity and clergy alike have
            immediate access to God through faith, and both are obliged to do
            what lies in them to further the advance of the kingdom of God
            among their fellow-men. All believing laymen <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“are worthy to appear before God, to pray for others,
            to teach each other mutually the things that are of God ... and
            as our heavenly Father has freely helped us in Christ, so we
            ought freely to help our neighbours by our body and our works,
            and each should become to the other a sort of Christ, so that we
            may be mutually Christs, and that the same Christ may be in all
            of us; that we may be truly Christians.”</span> Luther asserted
            that men and women living their lives in the family, in the
            workshop, in the civic world, held their position there, not by a
            kind of indirect permission wrung from God out of His compassion
            for human frailties, but by as direct a vocation as called a man
            to what by mistake had been deemed the only <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“religious life.”</span> The difference between
            clergy and laity did not consist in the supposed fact that the
            former were a spiritual order of a superior rank in the religious
            life, while the latter belonged to a lower condition. The clergy
            differed from the laity simply in this, that they had been
            selected to perform certain definite duties; but the function did
            not make him who performed it a holier man intrinsically. If the
            clergy misused their position and did not do the work they were
            set apart to perform, there was no reason why they should not be
            compelled by the laity to amend their ways. Even in the
            celebration of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg
            444]</span><a name="Pg444" id="Pg444" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            holiest rites there was no distinction between clergy and laity
            save that to prevent disorder the former presided over the rites
            in which all engaged. At the Eucharist</p>

            principle of the Priesthood of all Believers which delivered men
            from the vague fear of the clergy, and which was a spur to incite
            them to undertake the reformation of the Church which was so much
            needed. It is the one great religious principle which lies at the
            basis of the whole Reformation movement. It was the rock on which
            all attempts at reunion with an unreformed Christendom were
            wrecked. It is the one outstanding difference between the

            Faith.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Luther,
            oppressed with a sense of sin, entered the convent, he was
            burdened by the ideas of traditional religion, that the penitent
            must prepare himself in some way so as to render himself fit to
            experience that sense of the grace of God which gives the
            certainty of pardon. It was not until he had thoroughly freed
            himself from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page445">[pg
            445]</span><a name="Pg445" id="Pg445" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            that weight that he experienced the sense of pardon he sought.
            This practical experience of his must always be kept in view when
            we try to conceive what he meant by Justification by Faith.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As has been
            already said, Luther recognised that there were two kinds of
            faith,—one which man himself begot and through which he was able
            to give assent to doctrines of some sort; and another which
            Luther vehemently asserted was the pure gift of God. The first he
            thought comparatively unimportant; the latter was all in all to
            him. Faith is always used in the latter sense when the Reformers
            speak about <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Justification by Faith</span></em>; and the
            sharp distinction which Luther draws between the two is a very
            important element in determining what he meant when he said that
            we are justified by faith alone.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This faith of
            the highest kind, the true faith, has its beginning by God
            working on us and in us. It is continually fed and kept strong by
            the word of God. The promise of God on God's side and faith on
            man's side are two correlative things; <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“for where there is no promise, there is no
            faith.”</span> Luther brings out what this true faith is by
            contrasting it with the other kind of faith in two very
            instructive and trenchant passages:</p>

            <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
            "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
            <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
            "font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">When faith
            is of the kind that God awakens and creates in the heart, then a
            man trusts in Christ. He is then so securely founded on Christ
            that he can hurl defiance at sin, death, hell, the devil, and all
            God's enemies. He fears no ill, however hard and cruel it may
            prove to be. Such is the nature of true faith, which is utterly
            different from the faith of the sophists (the Schoolmen), Jews,
            and Turks. Their faith, produced by their thoughts, simply lights
            upon a thing, accepts it, believes that it is this or that. God
            has no dealings with such delusion; it is the work of man, and
            comes from nature, from the free will of man; and men possessing
            it can say, repeating what others have said: I believe that there
            is a God. I believe that Christ was born, died, rose again for
            me. But what the real faith is, and how powerful a thing it is,
            of this they know nothing.</span><span style=

            beware of that faith which is manufactured or imagined; for the
            true faith is not the work of man, and therefore the faith which
            is manufactured or imagined will not avail in death, but will be
            overcome and utterly overthrown by sin, by the devil, and by the
            pains of hell. The true faith is the heart's utter trust in
            Christ, and God alone awakens this in us. He who has it is
            blessed, he who has it not is cursed.</span><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This faith has
            an outside fact to rest upon—the historical Christ. It is neither
            helped nor hindered by a doctrine of the Person of Christ, nor by
            a minute and elaborate knowledge of the details of our Lord's
            earthly ministry. The man who has the faith may know a great deal
            about the doctrine of the Person of Christ: that will do his
            faith no harm but good, provided only he does not make the
            mistake of thinking that doctrines about Christ, ways by which
            the human understanding tries to conceive the fact, are either
            the fact itself or something better than the fact. He may know a
            great deal about the history of Jesus, and it is well to know as
            much as possible; but the amount of knowledge scarcely affects
            the faith. Wayfaring men, though fools, need not err in the
            pathway of faith.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The faith
            which is the gift of God makes us see the practical meaning in
            the fact of the historic Christ—this, namely, that Jesus Christ
            is there before us the manifestation of the Fatherly love of God,
            revealing to us our own forgiveness, and with it the
            possibilities of the Kingdom of God and of our place therein. The
            fact of the historic Christ is there, seen by men in a natural
            way; but it is the power of God lying in the faith which He has
            given us that makes us see with full certainty the meaning of the
            fact of the historic Christ for us and for our salvation.
            Moreover, this vision of God in the historic Christ, which is the
            deepest of all personal things, always involves something social.
            It brings us within the family of the faithful, within the
            Christian fellowship <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg
            447]</span><a name="Pg447" id="Pg447" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            with its confirming evidences of faith and love. The power of
            faith comes to us singly, but seldom solitarily; the trust we
            have in God in Christ is faintly mirrored in the faith we learn
            to have in the members of the household of faith, and in their
            manifestations of faith and the love which faith begets.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What has been
            called the doctrine of Justification by Faith is therefore rather
            the description of a religious experience within the believer;
            and the meaning of the experience is simply this. The believer,
            who because he has faith—the faith which is the gift of God,
            which is our life and which regenerates—is regenerate and a
            member of the Christian fellowship, and is able to do good works
            and actually does them, does not find his standing as a person
            justified in the sight of God, his righteousness, his assurance
            of pardon and salvation, in those good works which he really can
            do, but only in the mediatorial and perfectly righteous work of
            Christ which he has learned to appropriate in faith. His good
            works, however really good, are necessarily imperfect, and in
            this experience which we call Justification by Faith the believer
            compares his own imperfect good works with the perfect work of
            Christ, and recognises that his pardon and salvation depends on
            that alone. This comparison quiets souls anxious about their
            salvation, and soothes pious consciences; and the sense of
            forgiveness which comes in this way is always experienced as a
            revelation of wonderful love. This justification is called an
            act, and is contrasted with a work; but the contrast, though
            true, is apt to mislead through human analogies which will
            intrude. It is an act, but an act of God; and divine acts are
            never done and done with, they are always continuous. Luther
            rings the changes upon this. He warns us against thinking that
            the act of forgiveness is all done in a single moment. The
            priestly absolution was the work of a moment, and had to be done
            over and over again; but the divine pronouncement of pardon is
            continuous simply because it is God who makes it. He
            says:</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page448">[pg

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            Protestant polemic with Roman Catholic doctrine, the conception
            of Justification by Faith is contrasted with that of
            Justification by Works; but the contrast is somewhat misleading.
            For the word justification is used in different meanings in the
            two phrases. The direct counterpart in Roman Catholic usage to
            the Reformation thought of Justification by Faith is the
            absolution pronounced by a priest; and here as always the
            Reformer appeals from man to God. The two conceptions belong to
            separate spheres of thought.</p>

            justification of which the mediæval Christian had experience was
            the descending of an outward stream of forces upon him from the
            supersensible world, through the Incarnation, in the channels of
            ecclesiastical institutions, priestly consecration, sacraments,
            confession, and good works; it was something which came from his
            connection with a supersensible organisation which surrounded
            him. The justification by faith which Luther experienced within
            his soul was the personal experience of the believer standing in
            the continuous line of the Christian fellowship, who receives the
            assurance of the grace of God in his exercise of a personal
            faith,—an experience which comes from appropriating the work of
            Christ which he is able to do by that faith which is the gift of
            God.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the one
            case, the Protestant, justification is a personal experience
            which is complete in itself, and does not depend on any external
            machinery; in the other, the Mediæval, it is a prolonged action
            of usages, sacraments, external machinery of all kinds, which by
            their combined effect are supposed to change a sinner gradually
            into a saint, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg
            449]</span><a name="Pg449" id="Pg449" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            righteous in the eyes of God. With the former, it is a continuous
            experience; with the latter, it cannot fail to be intermittent as
            the external means are actually employed or for a time laid
            aside.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meaning of
            the Reformation doctrine of Justification by Faith may be further
            brought out by contrasting it with the theory which was taught by
            that later school of Scholastic theology which was all-powerful
            at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The more evangelical
            theory of Thomas Aquinas was largely neglected, and the
            Nominalist Schoolmen based their expositions of the doctrine on
            the teaching of John Duns Scotus.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must be
            remembered that mediæval theology never repudiated the theology
            of Augustine, and admitted in theory at least that man's
            salvation, and justification as part of it, always depended in
            the last resort on the prevenient grace of God; in their
            reverence for the teaching of Aristotle, they believed that they
            had also to make room for the action of the free will of man
            which they always looked on as the pure capacity of choice
            between two alternatives. John Duns Scotus got rid of a certain
            confusion which existed between the <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">gratia operans</span></span> and <span lang=
            "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">gratia co-operans</span></span> of Augustine
            by speaking of the grace of God, which lay at the basis of man's
            justification, as a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
            habitualis</span></span>, or an operation of the grace of God
            which gave to the will of man an habitual tendency to love
            towards God and man. He alleged that when conduct is considered,
            an act of the will is more important than any habitual tendency,
            for it is the act which makes use of the habit, and apart from
            the act, the habit is a mere inert passivity. Therefore, he held
            that the chief thing in meritorious conduct is not so much the
            habit which has been created by God's grace, as the act of will
            which makes use of the habit. In this way the grace of God is
            looked upon as simply the general basis of meritorious conduct,
            or a mere <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">conditio sine qua
            non</span></span>, and the important thing is the act of will
            which can make use of the otherwise passive habit. The process of
            justification—and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg
            450]</span><a name="Pg450" id="Pg450" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            it is to be remembered that the Schoolmen invariably looked upon
            justification as a process by which a sinner was gradually made
            into a righteous man and thoroughly and substantially changed—may
            therefore be described as an infusion of divine grace which
            creates a habit of the will towards love to God and to man; this
            is laid hold on by acts of the will, and there result positive
            acts of love towards God and man which are meritorious, and which
            gradually change a sinner into a righteous person. This is the
            theory; but the theory is changed into practice by being
            exhibited in the framework of the Church provided to aid men to
            appropriate the grace of God which is the basis for all. The
            obvious and easiest way to obtain that initial grace which is the
            starting-point is by the sacraments, which are said to infuse
            grace—the grace which is needed to make the start on the process
            of justification. Grace is infused to begin with in Baptism; and
            it is also infused from time to tune in the Eucharist. If a man
            has been baptized, he has the initial grace to start with; and he
            can get additions in the Eucharist. That, according to the
            theory, is all that is needed to start the will on its path of
            meritorious conduct. But while this exhibits the ideal process of
            justification according to mediæval theology, it must be
            remembered that there is mortal sin—sin which slays the new life
            begun in baptism—and the sacrament which renews the life slain
            will be practically more important than the sacrament which first
            creates it. Hence practically the whole process of the mediæval
            justification is best seen in the sacrament which renews the life
            slain by deadly sins. That sacrament is Penance; and the theory
            and practice of justification is best exhibited in the Sacrament
            of Penance. The good disposition of the will towards God is seen
            in confession; this movement towards God is complete when
            confession stimulated by the priest is finished; the performance
            of the meritorious good works is seen in the penitent performing
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“satisfactions,”</span> or tasks
            imposed by the priest, of prayer, of almsgiving, of maceration;
            while the absolution <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg
            451]</span><a name="Pg451" id="Pg451" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            announces that the process is complete, and that the sinner has
            become a righteous man and is in <span class="tei tei-q">“a state
            of grace.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In opposition
            to all this, Luther asserted that it was possible to go through
            all that process prescribed by the mediæval Church, embodying the
            Scholastic theory of justification, without ever having the real
            sense of pardon, or ever being comforted by the sense of the love
            of God. The faith, however, which is the gift of God makes the
            believer see in the Christ Who is there before him a revelation
            of God's Fatherly love which gives him the sense of pardon, and
            at the same time excites in him the desire to do all manner of
            loving service. He is like the forgiven child who is met with
            tenderness when punishment was expected, and in glad wonder
            resolves never to be naughty again—so natural and simple is the
            Reformation thought. That thought, however, can be put much more
            formally. Chemnitz expresses it thus:</p>

              been accepted to everlasting life. We hold, on the other hand,

              the Holy Spirit, but inasmuch as that righteousness is
              imperfect and still impure by reason of the flesh, all men
              cannot stand in God's judgment with it, nor on its account does

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence we may
            say that the difference in the two ways of looking at the matter

            "tei tei-anchor"></a> question, What does faith lay hold on in
            true repentance? The Reformation answer is—(1) not on a
            mechanically complete confession made to a priest, nor on a due
            performance of what the priest enjoins by way of satisfaction;
            but (2) only on what God in Christ has done for us, which is seen
            in the life, death, and rising again of the Saviour.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
            striking differences between the Reformation and the mediæval
            conception of justification are:</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) The
            Reformation thought always looks at the comparative <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">imperfection</span></em> of the works of
            believers, while admitting that they are good works; the mediæval
            theologian, even when bidding men disregard the intrinsic value
            of their good works, always looks at the relative <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">perfection</span></em> of these works.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) The
            Reformer had a much more concrete idea of God's grace—it was
            something special, particular, unique—because he invariably
            regarded the really good works which men can do from their
            relative imperfection; the mediæval theologian looked at the
            relative perfection of good works, and so could represent them as
            something congruous to the grace of God which was not sharply
            distinguished from them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) These
            views led Luther and the Reformers to represent faith as not
            merely the receptive organ for the reception and appropriation of
            justification through Christ, but, and in addition, as the active
            instrument in all Christian life and work—faith is our life;
            while the mediæval theologians never attained this view of
            faith.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) The
            Reformer believes that the act of faith in his justification
            through Christ is the basis of the believer's assurance of his
            pardon and salvation in spite of the painful and abiding sense of
            sin; while the mediæval theologian held that the divine sentence
            of acquittal which restored a sinner to a state of grace resulted
            from the joint action of the priest and the penitent in the
            Sacrament of Penance, and had to be repeated intermittently.</p>

            same way as He had done in earlier days to His prophets and
            Apostles. They believed that if the common people had the
            Scriptures in a language which they could understand, they could
            hear God speaking to them directly, and could go to Him for
            comfort, warning, or instruction; and their description of what
            they meant by the Holy Scriptures is simply another way of saying
            that all believers can have access to the very presence of God.
            The Scriptures were therefore for them a personal rather than a
            dogmatic revelation. They record the experience of a fellowship
            with God enjoyed by His saints in past ages, which may still be
            shared in by the faithful. In Bible history as the Reformers
            conceived it, we hear two voices—the voice of God speaking love
            to man, and the voice of the renewed man answering in faith to
            God. This communion is no dead thing belonging to a bygone past;
            it may be shared here and now.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
            Reformation conception of Scripture is continually stated in such
            a way as to deprive it of the eminently religious aspect that it
            had for men of the sixteenth century. It is continually said that
            the Reformers placed the Bible, an infallible Book, over-against
            an infallible Church; and transferred the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">same
            kind</span></em> of infallibility which had been supposed to
            belong to the Church to this book. In mediæval times, men
            accepted the decisions of Popes and Councils as the last decisive
            utterance on all matters of controversy in doctrine and morals;
            at the Reformation, the Reformers, it is said, placed the Bible
            where these Popes and Councils had been, and declared that the
            last and final appeal was to be made to its pages. This mode of
            stating the question has found its most concise expression in the
            saying of Chillingworth, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Bible
            and the Bible alone is the religion of Protestants.”</span> It is
            quite true that the Reformers did set the authority of the
            Scriptures over <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg
            454]</span><a name="Pg454" id="Pg454" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            against that of Popes and Councils, and that Luther declared that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the common man,”</span> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“miller's maid,”</span> or <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“boy of nine”</span> with the Bible knew more about
            divine truth than the Pope without the Bible; but this is not the
            whole truth, and is therefore misleading. For Romanists and
            Protestants do not mean the same thing by <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Scripture</span></em>, nor do they mean the
            same thing by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Infallibility</span></em>, and their
            different use of the words is a most important part of the
            Reformation conception of Scripture.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
            difference in the meaning of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Scripture</span></em>
            is partly external and partly internal; and the latter is the
            more important of the two.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Scriptures</span></em> to which the Romanist
            appeals include the Apocryphal Books of the Old Testament; and
            the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Scriptures</span></em> which are
            authoritative are not the books of the Old and New Testament in
            the original tongues, but a translation into Latin known as the
            Vulgate of Pope Sixtus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">v.</span></span> They are therefore a
            book to a large extent different from the one to which
            Protestants appeal.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However
            important this external difference may be, it is nothing in
            comparison with the internal difference; and yet the latter is
            continually forgotten by Protestants as well as by Roman
            Catholics in their arguments.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To understand
            it, one must remember that every mediæval theologian declared
            that the whole doctrinal system of his Church was based upon the
            Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. The Reformers did
            nothing unusual, nothing which was in opposition to the common
            practice of the mediæval Church in which they had been born,
            educated, and lived, when they appealed to Scripture. Luther made
            his appeal with the same serene unconsciousness that anyone could
            gainsay him, as he did when he set the believer's spiritual
            experience of the fact that he rested on Christ alone for
            salvation against the proposal to sell pardon for money. His
            opponents never attempted to challenge his right to make this
            appeal to Scripture—at least at first. They made the same appeal
            themselves; they believed that they were able to meet Scripture
            with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page455">[pg
            455]</span><a name="Pg455" id="Pg455" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            Scripture. They were confident that the authority appealed
            to—Scripture—would decide against Luther. It soon became
            apparent, however, that Luther had an unexpectedly firmer grasp
            of Scripture than they had. This did not mean that he had a
            better memory for texts. It was seen that Luther somehow was able
            to look at and use Scripture as one transparent whole; while they
            looked on it as a collection of fragmentary texts. This gave him
            and other Reformers a skill in the use of Scripture which their
            opponents began to feel that they were deficient in. They felt
            that if they were to meet their opponents on equal terms they too
            must recognise a unity in Scripture. They did so by creating an
            external and arbitrary unity by means of the dogmatic tradition
            of the mediæval Church. Hence the decree of the Council of Trent,
            which manufactured an artificial unity for Scripture by placing
            the dogmatic tradition of the Church alongside Scripture as an
            equal source of authority. The reason why the Reformers found a
            natural unity in the Bible, and why the Romanists had to
            construct an artificial one, lay, as we shall see, in their
            different conceptions of what was meant by saving faith.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mediæval
            theologians looked at the Bible as a sort of spiritual law-book,
            a storehouse of divinely communicated knowledge of doctrinal
            truths and rules for moral conduct—and nothing more.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Reformers
            saw in it a new home for a new life within which they could have
            intimate fellowship with God Himself—not merely knowledge about
            God, but actual communion with Him.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is one
            great difficulty attending the mediæval conception of the
            Scriptures, that it does not seem applicable to a large part of
            them. There is abundant material provided for the construction of
            doctrines and moral rules; but that is only a portion of what is
            contained in the Scriptures. The Bible contains long lists of
            genealogies, chapters which contain little else than a
            description of temple furniture, stories of simple human
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a name=
            "Pg456" id="Pg456" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> life, and details
            of national history. The mediæval theologian had either to
            discard altogether a large part of the Bible or to transform it
            somehow into doctrinal and moral teaching. The latter alternative
            was chosen, and the instrument of transformation was the thought
            of the various senses in Scripture which plays such a prominent
            part in every mediæval statement of the nature and uses of the
            revelation of God contained in the Bible.<a id="noteref_404"
            name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class=

            one can deny that a book, where instruction is frequently given
            in parables, or by means of aphorisms and proverbial sayings,
            must contain many passages which have different senses. It may be
            admitted, to use Origen's illustrations, that the grain of
            mustard seed is, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">literally</span></em>, an actual seed;
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">morally</span></em>, faith in the individual
            believer; and, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">allegorically</span></em>, the kingdom of
            God;<a id="noteref_405" name="noteref_405" href=
            "#note_405"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">405</span></span></a> or,
            though this is more doubtful, that the little foxes are,
            literally, cubs; morally, sins in the individual heart; and,
            allegorically, heresies which distract and spoil the
            Church.<a id="noteref_406" name="noteref_406" href=
            "#note_406"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">406</span></span></a> But
            to say that every detail of personal or national life in the Old
            Testament or New is merely dead history, of no spiritual value
            until it has been transformed into a doctrinal truth or a moral
            rule by the application of the theory of the fourfold sense in
            Scripture, is to destroy the historical character of revelation
            altogether, and, besides, to introduce complete uncertainty about
            what any passage was really meant to declare. The use of a
            fourfold sense—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">literal</span></em>, <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">anagogic</span></em>—enables the reader to
            draw any meaning he pleases from any portion of Scripture.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While mediæval
            theologians, by their bewildering fourfold sense, made it almost
            hopeless to know precisely what the Bible actually taught,
            another idea of theirs made it essential to salvation that men
            should attain to an absolutely <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page457">[pg 457]</span><a name="Pg457" id="Pg457" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> correct statement of what the Scriptures
            did reveal about God and man and the relation between them. They
            held that faith—the faith which saves—was not trust in a person,
            but assent to correct propositions about God, the universe, and
            the soul of man; and the saving character of the assent depended
            on the correctness of the propositions assented to. It is the
            submission of the intellect to certain propositional statements
            which are either seen to be correct or are accepted as being so
            because guaranteed in some supernatural way. Infallibility is
            looked upon as that which can guarantee the perfect correctness
            of propositions about God and man in their relations to each
            other.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">If</span></em> it
            be necessary to employ the fourfold sense to confuse the plain
            meaning of the greater portion of Scripture, and <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if</span></em>
            salvation depends on arriving at a perfectly correct intellectual
            apprehension of abstract truths contained somewhere in the Bible,
            then Lacordaire's sarcastic reference to the Protestant
            conception of Scripture is not out of place. He says:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“What kind of a religion is that which
            saves men by aid of a book? God has given the book, but He has
            not guaranteed your private interpretation of it. What guarantee
            have you that your thoughts do not shove aside God's ideas? The
            heathen carves himself a god out of wood or marble; the
            Protestant carves his out of the Bible. If there be a true
            religion on earth, it must be of the most <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">serene</span></em> and unmistakable
            authority.”</span><a id="noteref_407" name="noteref_407" href=
            "#note_407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">407</span></span></a> We
            need not wonder at John Nathin saying to his perplexed pupil in
            the Erfurt Convent: <span class="tei tei-q">“Brother Martin, let
            the Bible alone; read the old teachers; reading the Bible simply

            can sympathise with some of the earlier printers of the German
            Vulgate when they inserted in their prefaces that readers must be
            careful to understand the contents of the volume in the way
            declared by the Church.<a id="noteref_409" name="noteref_409"

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">409</span></span></a> Men
            who went to the Bible might go wrong, and it was spiritual death
            to make any mistake; but all who simply assented to the
            interpretation of the Bible given in the <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page458">[pg 458]</span><a name="Pg458" id="Pg458" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Church's theology were kept right and had
            the true or saving faith. Such was the mediæval idea.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But all this
            made it impossible to find in the Bible a means of communion with
            God. Between the God Who had revealed Himself there and man, the
            mediæval theologian, perhaps unconsciously at first, had placed
            what he called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Church,”</span> but
            what really was the opinions of accredited theologians confirmed
            by decisions of Councils or Popes. The <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Church”</span> had barred the way of access to the
            mind and heart of God in the Scriptures by interposing its
            authoritative method of interpretation between the believer and
            the Bible, as it had interposed the priesthood between the sinner
            and the redeeming Saviour.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as the
            Reformers had opposed their personal experience of pardon won by
            throwing themselves on the mercy of God revealed in Christ to the
            intervention of the Church between them and God, so they
            controverted this idea of the Scriptures by the personal
            experience of what the Bible had been to them. They had felt and
            known that the personal God, Who had made them and redeemed them,
            was speaking to them in this Book, and was there making manifest
            familiarly His power and His willingness to save. The speech was
            sometimes obscure, but they read on and lighted on other passages
            which were plainer, and they made the easier explain the more
            difficult. The <span class="tei tei-q">“common”</span> man
            perhaps could not understand it all, nor fit all the sayings of
            Scripture into a connected whole of intellectual truth; but all,
            plain men and theologians alike, could hear their Father's voice,
            learn their Redeemer's purpose, and have faith in their Lord's
            promises. It was a good thing to put text to text and build a
            system of Protestant divinity to which their intellects could
            assent; but it was not essential. Saving faith was not
            intellectual assent at all. It was simple trust—the trust of a
            child—in their Father's promises, which were Yea and Amen in
            Christ Jesus. The one essential thing was to hear and obey the
            personal God speaking to them as He had spoken all down through
            the ages to His people, promising His salvation now in
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg 459]</span><a name=
            "Pg459" id="Pg459" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> direct words, now
            in pictures of His dealings with a favoured man or a chosen
            people. No detail of life was dead history; for it helped to fill
            the picture of communion between God and His people. The picture
            was itself a promise that what had been in the past would be
            renewed in their own experience of fellowship with a gracious
            God, if only they had the same faith which these saints of the
            Old and New Testaments enjoyed.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With these
            thoughts burning in their hearts, the Bible could not be to the
            Reformers what it had been to the mediæval theologians. God was
            speaking to them in it as a man speaks to his fellows. The simple
            historical sense was the important one in the great majority of
            passages. The Scripture was more than a storehouse of doctrines
            and moral rules. It was over and above the record and picture of
            the blessed experience which God's saints have had in fellowship
            with their covenant God since the first revelation of the
            Promise. So they made haste to translate the Bible into all
            languages in order to place it in the hands of every man, and
            said that the <span class="tei tei-q">“common man”</span> with
            the Bible in his hands (with God speaking to him) could know more
            about the way of salvation than Pope or Councils without the
            Scriptures.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The change of
            view which separated the Reformers from mediæval theologians
            almost amounted to a rediscovery of Scripture; and it was
            effected by their conception of faith. Saving faith was for them
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">personal trust</span></em> in a <em class=

            Saviour</span></em> Who had manifested in His life and work the
            Fatherly mercy of God. This was not a mere theological
            definition; it was a description of an experience which they knew
            that they had lived. It made them see that the word of God was a
            personal and not a dogmatic revelation; that the real meaning in
            it was that God Himself was there behind every word of it,—not an
            abstract truth, but a personal Father. On the one side, on the
            divine, there was God pouring out His whole heart and revealing
            the inmost treasures of His righteousness and love in Christ the
            Incarnate Word; on the other side, on the human, there was the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg 460]</span><a name=
            "Pg460" id="Pg460" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> believing soul
            looking straight through all works and all symbols and all words
            to Christ Himself, united to Him by faith in the closest personal
            union. Such a blessed experience—the feeling of direct fellowship
            between the believer and God Incarnate, of a communion such as
            exists between two loving human souls, brought about by the
            twofold stream of God's personal word coming down, and man's
            personal faith going up to God—could not fail to give an entirely
            new conception of Scripture. The mediæval Church looked on the
            Jesus Christ revealed in Scripture as a Teacher sent from God;
            and revelation was for them above all things an imparting of
            speculative truth. To the Reformers the chief function of
            Scripture was to bring Jesus Christ near us; and as Jesus always
            fills the full sphere of God to them, the chief end of Scripture
            is to bring God near <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">me</span></em>. It is the direct message of
            God's love to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">me</span></em>,—not doctrine, but promise
            (for apart from promise, as Luther said unweariedly, faith does
            not exist); not display of God's thoughts, but of God Himself as
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">my</span></em> God. This manifestation of
            God, which is recorded for us in the Scriptures, took place in an
            historical process coming to its fullest and highest in the
            incarnation and historical work of Christ, and the record of the
            manifestation has been framed so as to include everything
            necessary to enable us to understand the declaration of God's
            will in its historical context and in its historical
            manifestation. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let no pious
            Christian,”</span> says Luther, <span class="tei tei-q">“stumble
            at the simple word and story that meet him so often in
            Scripture.”</span> These are never the dead histories of the
            mediæval theologian,—events which have simply taken place and
            concern men no more. They tell how God dealt with His faithful
            people in ages past, and they are promises of how He will act
            towards us now. <span class="tei tei-q">“Abraham's history is
            precious,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“because it is
            filled so full of God's Word, with which all that befell him is
            so adorned and so fair, and because God goes everywhere before
            him with His Word, promising, commanding, comforting, warning,
            that we may verily see that Abraham was God's special trusty
            friend. Let us mirror ourselves, then, in this holy father
            Abraham, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg
            461]</span><a name="Pg461" id="Pg461" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            who walks not in gold and velvet, but girded, crowned, and
            clothed with divine light, that is, with God's Word.”</span> The
            simplest Bible stories, even geographical and architectural
            details, may and do give us the sidelights necessary to complete
            the manifestation of God to His people.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question
            now arises, Where and in what are we to recognise the
            infallibility and authoritative character of Scripture? It is
            manifest that the ideas attaching to these words must change with
            the changed conception of the essential character of that
            Scripture to which they belong. Nor can the question be discussed
            apart from the Reformation idea of saving faith; for the two
            thoughts of Scripture and saving faith always correspond. In
            mediæval theology they are always primarily intellectual and
            prepositional; in Reformation thinking, they are always in the
            first instance experimental and personal. In describing the
            authoritative character of Scripture, the Reformers always
            insisted that its recognition was awakened in believers by that
            operation which they called the witness of the Holy Spirit
            (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Testimonium Spiritus
            Sancti</span></span>). Just as God Himself makes us know and feel
            the sense of pardon in an inward experience by a faith which is
            His own work, so they believed that by an operation of the same
            Spirit, believers were enabled to recognise that God Himself is
            speaking to us authoritatively in and through the words of
            Scripture.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their view of
            what is meant by the authority and infallibility of Scripture
            cannot be seen apart from what they taught about the relation
            between Scripture and the word of God. They have all the same
            general conception, however they may differ in details in their
            statement. If Luther, as his wont was, speaks more trenchantly,
            and Calvin writes with a clearer vision of the consequences which
            must follow from his assertions, both have the same great thought
            before them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Reformers
            drew a distinction between the word of God and the Scripture
            which contains or presents that word. This distinction was real
            and not merely formal; it was more than the difference between
            the word of God <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page462">[pg
            462]</span><a name="Pg462" id="Pg462" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            and the word of God written; and important consequences were
            founded upon it. If the use of metaphor be allowed, the word of
            God is to the Scripture as the soul is to the body. Luther
            believed that while the word of God was presented in every part
            of Scripture, some portions make it much more evident. He
            instances the Gospel and First Epistle of St. John, the Epistles
            of St. Paul, especially those to the Romans, to the Galatians,
            and to the Ephesians, and the First Epistle of St. Peter.<a id=
            "noteref_410" name="noteref_410" href="#note_410"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">410</span></span></a> He
            declares that if Christians possessed no other books besides
            those, the way of salvation would be perfectly clear. He adds
            elsewhere that the word of God shines forth with special
            clearness in the Psalms, which he called the Bible within the
            Bible.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther says
            that the word of God may be described in the phrase of St. Paul,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Gospel of God, which He promised
            afore by His Prophets in the Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son,
            who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was
            declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit
            of holiness, by the resurrection of the dead.”</span><a id=

            Calvin calls it <span class="tei tei-q">“the spiritual teaching,
            the gate, as it were, by which we enter into His heavenly
            kingdom,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“a mirror in which faith

            Zwingli declares it to be <span class="tei tei-q">“that our Lord

            is the sum of God's commands, threatenings, and promises,
            addressed to our faith, and above all the gospel offer of Christ
            to us. This word of God need not take the form of direct
            exhortation; it may be recognised in the simple histories of men
            or of nations recorded in the Scripture.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This true and
            real distinction between the word of God and Scripture may easily
            be perverted to something which all the Reformers would have
            repudiated. It must not be explained by the common mystical
            illustration of kernel and husk, which husk (the record) may be
            thrown away when the kernel (the word) has been once reached and
            laid hold of. Nor can it be used to mean that one part of the
            Bible is the word of God and that another is not. The Reformers
            uniformly teach that the substance of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>
            Scripture is the word of God, and that what is no part of the
            record of the word of God is not Scripture. Finally, the
            distinction between the two need not prevent us saying that the
            Scripture is the word of God. Luther is very peremptory about
            this. He says that he is ready to discuss differences with any
            opponent who admits that the evangelical writings are the word of
            God; but that if this be denied he will refuse to argue; for
            where is the good of reasoning with anyone who denies first
            principles? (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">prima
            principia</span></span>)<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415"

            Only it must be clearly understood that the copula <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>
            does not express logical identity, but some such relation as can
            be more exactly rendered by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">contains</span></em>, <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">records</span></em>,—all of which phrases
            are used in the writings of Reformers or in the creeds of the
            Reformation Churches. The main thing to <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a name="Pg464" id="Pg464" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> remember is that the distinction is not to
            be made use of to deny to the substance of Scripture those
            attributes of authority and infallibility which belong to the
            word of God.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
            hand, there is a vital religious interest in the distinction. In
            the first place it indicates what is meant by the infallibility
            of Scripture, and in the second it enables us to distinguish
            between the divine and the human elements in the Bible.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            authoritative character and infallibility belong really and
            primarily to the word of God, and only secondarily to the
            Scriptures,—to Scripture only because it is the record which
            contains, presents, or conveys the word of God. It is this word
            of God, this personal manifestation to us for our salvation of
            God in His promises, which is authoritative and infallible; and
            Scripture shares these attributes only in so far as it is a
            vehicle of spiritual truth. It is the unanimous declaration of
            the Reformers that Scripture is Scripture because it gives us
            that knowledge of God and of His will which is necessary for
            salvation; because it presents to the eye of faith God Himself
            personally manifesting Himself in Christ. It is this presentation
            of God Himself and of His will for our salvation which is
            infallible and authoritative. But this manifestation of God
            Himself is something spiritual, and is to be apprehended by a
            spiritual faculty which is faith, and the Reformers and the
            Confessions of the Reformation do not recognise any infallibility
            or divine authority which is otherwise apprehended than by faith.
            If this be so, the infallibility is of quite another kind from
            that described by mediæval theologians or modern Roman Catholics,
            and it is also very different from what many modern Protestants
            attribute to the Scriptures when they do not distinguish them
            from the word of God. With the mediæval theologian infallibility
            was something which guaranteed the perfect correctness of
            abstract propositions; with some modern Protestants it consists
            in the conception that the record contains not even the smallest
            error in word or description of fact—in <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page465">[pg 465]</span><a name="Pg465" id="Pg465" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> its inerrancy. But neither inerrancy nor
            the correctness of abstract propositions is apprehended by faith
            in the Reformers' sense of that word; they are matters of fact,
            to be accepted or rejected by the ordinary faculties of man. The
            infallibility and authority which need faith to perceive them
            are, and must be, something very different; they produce the
            conviction that in the manifestation of God in His word there
            lies infallible power to save. This is given, all the Reformers
            say, by the Witness of the Spirit; <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            true kirk alwaies heares and obeyis the voice of her awin spouse
            and pastor.”</span><a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href=
            "#note_416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a>
            Calvin discusses the authority and credibility of Scripture in
            his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Institutio</span></span>, and says:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Let it be considered, then, as an
            undeniable truth that they who have been inwardly taught of the
            Spirit feel an entire acquiescence in the Scripture, and that it
            is self-authenticated, carrying with it its own evidence, and
            ought not to be made the subject of demonstration and arguments
            from reason; but that it obtains the credit which it deserves
            with us by the testimony of the Spirit.”</span><a id=
            "noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href="#note_417"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a>
            This is a religious conception of infallibility very different
            from the mediæval or the modern Romanist.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            distinction between the word of God and Scripture also serves to
            distinguish between the divine and the human elements in
            Scripture, and to give each its proper place.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Infallibility
            and divine authority belong to the sphere of faith and of the
            witness of the Spirit, and, therefore, to that personal
            manifestation of God and of His will toward us which is conveyed
            or presented to us in every part of Scripture. But this
            manifestation is given in a course of events which are part of
            human history, in lives of men and peoples, in a record which in
            outward form is like other human writings. If every part of
            Scripture is divine, every part of it is also human. The
            supernatural reality is incased in human realities. To apprehend
            the former, faith illumined by the Holy Spirit is necessary;
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page466">[pg 466]</span><a name=
            "Pg466" id="Pg466" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> but it is
            sufficient to use the ordinary methods of research to learn the
            credibility of the history in Scripture. When the Reformers
            distinguished between the word of God and Scripture which conveys
            or presents it, and when they declared that the authority and
            infallibility of that word belonged to the region of faith, they
            made that authority and infallibility altogether independent of
            questions that might be raised about the human agencies through
            which the book came into its present shape. It is not a matter
            belonging to the region of faith when the books which record the
            word of God were written, or by whom, or in what style, or how
            often they were edited or re-edited. It is not a matter for faith
            whether incidents happened in one country or in another; whether
            the account of Job be literal history, or a poem based on old
            traditions in which the author has used the faculty of
            imagination to illustrate the problems of God's providence and
            man's probation; whether genealogical tables give the names of
            men or of countries and peoples. All these and the like matters
            belong to the human side of the record. No special illumination
            of faith is needed to apprehend and understand them. They are
            matters for the ordinary faculties of man, and subject to
            ordinary human investigation. Luther availed himself freely of
            the liberty thus given. He never felt himself bound to accept the
            traditional ideas about the extent of the canon, the authorship
            of the books of the Bible, or even about the credibility of some
            of the things recorded. He said, speaking about Genesis,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“What though Moses never wrote
            it?”</span><a id="noteref_418" name="noteref_418" href=

            was enough for him that the book was there and that he could read
            it. He thought that the Books of Kings were more worthy of credit
            than the Books of Chronicles;<a id="noteref_419" name=

            he believed that the prophets had not always given the kings of
            Israel the best political advice.<a id="noteref_420" name=

            record of the revelation of God, and has been carefully guarded
            and protected by God. This thought always enters into the
            conception which the Reformers had of Scripture. They speak of
            the singular care and providence of God which has preserved the
            Scriptures in such a way that His people always have a full and
            unmistakable declaration in them of His mind and will for their
            salvation. This idea for ever forbids a careless or irreverent
            biblical criticism, sheltering itself under the liberty of
            dealing with the records of revelation. No one can say beforehand
            how much or how little of the historic record is essential to
            preserve the faith of the Church; but every devout Christian
            desires to have it in large abundance. No one can plead the
            liberty which the principles of the Reformers secure for dealing
            with the record of Scripture as a justification in taking a
            delight in reducing to a minimum the historical basis of the
            Christian faith. Careless or irreverent handling of the text of
            Holy Scripture is what all the Reformers abhorred.<a id=

            thereto, and in this way we belong to the old Church and are one
            with it.”</span> Both the Augsburg Confession and the Schmalkald
            Articles begin with restating the doctrines of the old Catholic
            Church as these are given in the Apostles', Nicene, and
            Athanasian Creeds, the two latter being always regarded by Luther
            as explanatory of the Apostles' Creed. His criticism of
            theological doctrines was always confined to the theories
            introduced by the Schoolmen, and to the perversion of the old
            doctrines of the Church introduced in mediæval times mainly to
            bring these doctrines into conformity with the principles of the
            philosophy of Aristotle. He brought two charges against the
            Scholastic Theology. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page469">[pg
            469]</span><a name="Pg469" id="Pg469" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            It was, he insisted, committed to the idea of work-righteousness;
            whatever occasional protest might be made against the conception,
            he maintained that this thought of work-righteousness was so
            interwoven with its warp and woof that the whole must be swept
            away ere the old and true Christian Theology could be
            rediscovered. He also declared it was sophistry; and by that he
            meant that it played with the outsides of doctrine, asked and
            solved questions which had nothing to do with real Christian
            theology, that the imposing intellectual edifice was hollow
            within, that its deity was not the God and Father revealed in
            Jesus Christ, but the unknown God, the God who could never be
            revealed by metaphysics larded with detached texts of Scripture,
            the abstract entity of pagan philosophy. With an unerring
            instinct he fastened on the Scholastic devotion to Aristotle as
            the reason why what professed to be Christian theology had been
            changed into something else. Scholastic Philosophy or Theology
            (for the two are practically the same) defined itself as the
            attempt to reconcile <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">faith</span></em> and <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">reason</span></em>, and the definition has
            been generally accepted. Verbally it is correct; really it is
            very misleading from the meanings attached to the words faith and
            reason. With the Schoolmen, faith in this contrast between faith
            and reason meant the sum of patristic teaching about the verities
            of the Christian religion extracted by the Fathers from the Holy
            Scriptures; and reason meant the sum of philosophical principles
            extracted from the writings of ancient philosophers, and
            especially from Aristotle. The great Schoolmen conceived it to be
            their task to construct a system of Christian Philosophy by
            combining patristic doctrinal conclusions with the conclusions of
            human reasoning which they believed to be given in their highest
            form in the writings of the ancient Grecian sages. They actually
            used the conceptions of the Fathers as material to give body to
            the forms of thought found ready made for them in the
            speculations of Aristotle and Plato. The Christian material was
            moulded to fit the pagan forms, and in consequence lost its most

            Christian characteristics. One can see how the most evangelical
            of the Schoolmen, Thomas Aquinas, tries in vain to break through
            the meshes of the Aristotelian net in his discussions on merit
            and satisfaction in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            which can never imprison without practically destroying the
            vision of the Father who has revealed Himself in the Saviour
            Jesus Christ. His other starting-point, that man is to be
            described as the possessor of free will in the Aristotelian sense
            of the term, will never contain the Christian doctrine of man's
            complete dependence on God in his salvation. It inevitably led to
            work-righteousness. This was the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“sophistry”</span> Luther protested against and which
            he swept away.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He then
            claimed that he stood where the old Catholic Church had taken
            stand, that his theology like its was rooted in the faith of God
            as Trinity and in the belief in the Person of Christ, the
            Revealer of God. The old theology had nothing to do with
            Mariolatry or saint worship; it revered the triune God, and Jesus
            Christ His Son and man's Saviour. Luther could join hands with
            Athanasius across twelve centuries. He had done a work not unlike
            that of the great Alexandrian. His rejection of the Scholastic
            Aristotelianism may be compared with Athanasius' refusal to allow
            the Logos theology any longer to confuse the Christian doctrines
            of God and the Person of Christ. Both believed that in all
            thinking about God they ought to keep their eyes fixed upon His
            redemptive work manifested in the historical Christ. Athanasius,
            like Luther, brought theology back to religion from <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“sophistry,”</span> and had for his starting-point an
            inward religious experience that his Redeemer was the God who
            made heaven and earth. The great leaders in the ancient Church,
            Luther <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page471">[pg
            471]</span><a name="Pg471" id="Pg471" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            believed, held as he did that to have conceptions about God, to
            construct a real Christian theology, it was necessary first of
            all to know God Himself, and that He was only to be known through
            the Lord Jesus Christ. He had gone through the same experience as
            they had done; he could fully sympathise with them, and could
            appropriate the expressions in which they had described and
            crystallised what they had felt and known, and that without
            paying much attention to the niceties of technical language.
            These doctrines had not been dead formulas to them, but the
            expression of a living faith. He could therefore take the old
            dogmas and make them live again in an age in which it seemed as
            if they had lost all their vitality.</p>

            was careful to avoid using them in his Short and even in his Long
            Catechism. But Jesus Christ was for him the mirror of the
            Fatherly heart of God, and therefore was God; God Himself was the
            only Comforter to bring rest to the human soul, and the Holy
            Spirit was God; and the old creeds confessed One God, Father,
            Son, and Holy Ghost, and the confession contented him whatever
            words were used. Besides, he rejoiced to place himself side by
            side with the Christians of ancient days, who trusted God in
            Christ and were free from the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“sophistries”</span> of the Schoolmen.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although
            Luther accepted, honestly and joyfully, the old theology about
            God and the Person of Christ, he put a new and richer meaning
            into it. Luther lets us see over and over again that he believed
            that the only thing worth considering in theology was the divine
            work of Christ and the experience that we have of it through
            faith. He did not believe that we have any real knowledge of God
            outside these limits. Beyond them there is the unknown God of
            philosophical paganism, the God whom Jews, Turks, pagans, and
            nominal Christians ignorantly worship. In order to know God it is
            necessary to know Him through the Jesus Christ of history. Hence
            with Luther, Christ fills the whole sphere of God: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father,”</span>
            and conversely: <span class="tei tei-q">“He that hath not seen Me
            hath not seen the Father.”</span> The historical Jesus Christ is
            for Luther the revealer and the only revealer of the Father. The
            revelation is given in the wonderful experience of faith in which
            Jesus compels us to see God in Him—the whole of God, Who has kept
            nothing back which He could have given us. It is very doubtful
            whether the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page473">[pg
            473]</span><a name="Pg473" id="Pg473" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            framers of the old creeds ever grasped this thought. The great
            expounder of the old theology, Augustine, certainly did not. The
            failure to enter into it showed itself not merely in the doctrine
            of God, but also in the theories of grace. With Luther all
            theology is really Christology; he knew no other God than the God
            Who had manifested Himself in the historical Christ, and made us
            see in the miracle of faith that He is our salvation. This at
            once simplifies all Christian theology and cuts it clearly away
            from that Scholastic which Luther called <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“sophistry.”</span> Why need Christians puzzle
            themselves over the Eternal Something which is not the world when
            they have the Father? On the old theology the work of Christ was
            practically limited to procuring the forgiveness of sins. There
            it ended and other gracious operations of God began—operations of
            grace. So there grew the complex system of expiations, and
            satisfactions, of magical sacraments and saints' intercessions.
            These were all at once swept away when the whole God was seen
            revealed in Christ in the vision of faith and nowhere else.</p>

            this over and over again. If we cannot say God died for us, if it
            was only a man who suffered on the cross, then we are lost, was
            Luther's firmest conviction; and the thought of the Divinity of
            Christ meant more to Luther than it did to previous theologians.
            The old theology <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page474">[pg
            474]</span><a name="Pg474" id="Pg474" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            had described the two Natures in the One Person of the God-man in
            such a way as to suggest that the only function of the Divine was
            to give to the human work of Christ the importance necessary to
            effect salvation. Luther always refused to adopt this limited way
            of regarding the Divinity of the Saviour. He did not refuse to
            adopt and use the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">phraseology</span></em> of his predecessors.
            Like them, he spoke of the two Natures in the One Person of
            Christ. But it is plain from his expositions of the Creed, and
            from his criticisms of the current theological terminology, that
            he did not like the expression. He thought that it suggested an
            idea that was wrong, and that had to be guarded against. He says
            that we must beware of thinking as if the deity and humanity in
            Christ are so externally united that we may look at the one apart
            from the other.</p>

            speaks, and wills the Father also wills, then I defy all that may

            thought of the Person of Christ into the closest relation to our
            personal experience. It is not simply a doctrine—an intellectual
            something outside us. It is part of that blessed experience which
            is called Justification by Faith. It is inseparably connected
            with the recognition that we are not saved by means of the good
            deeds which we can do, but solely by the work of Christ. It is
            what makes us cease all work-righteousness and trust in God alone
            as He has revealed Himself in Christ. When we know and feel that
            it is God who is working for us, then we instinctively cease
            trying to think that we can work <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps it
            ought to be added, although what has been said implies it, that
            Luther always approached the Person of Christ from his
            mediatorial work, and not from any previously thought out ideas
            of what Godhead must be, and what manhood must be, and how they
            can be united. He begins with the mediatorial and saving work of
            Christ as that is revealed in the blessed experience which faith,
            the gift of God, creates. He rises from, the office to the
            Person, and does not descend from the Person to the office.

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It can
            scarcely be said that all the Reformers worked out the conception
            of the Person of Christ in the same way as Luther, although
            almost all these thoughts can be found in Calvin, but the
            overshadowing conception is always present to their mind—Christ
            fills the full sphere of God. That is the characteristic of
            Reformation thought and of Reformation piety, and appears
            everywhere in the writings of the Reformers and in the worship
            and rites of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page476">[pg

            Reformed Church. To go into the matter exhaustively would
            necessitate more space than can be given; but the following
            instances may be taken as indicating the universal thought.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. The
            Reformers swept away every contemplation of intercessors who were
            supposed to share with our Lord the procuring of pardon and
            salvation, and they declared against all attempts to distinguish
            between various kinds of worship which could only lead pious
            souls astray from the one worship due to God in Christ. Such
            subtle distinctions, says Calvin, as <span lang="el" class=

            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">hyperdoulia</span></span> are neither known
            nor present to the minds of those who prostrate themselves before
            images until the world has become full of idolatry as crude and
            plain as that of the ancient Egyptians, which all the prophets
            continuously denounced: they can only mislead, and ought to be
            discarded. They actually suggest to worshippers to pass by Jesus
            Christ, the only Mediator, and betake themselves to some patron
            who has struck their fancy. They bring it about that the Divine
            Offices are distributed among the saints as if they had been
            appointed colleagues to our Lord Jesus Christ; and they are made
            to do His work, while He Himself is kept in the background like
            some ordinary person in a crowd. They are responsible for the
            fact that hymns are sung in public worship in which the saints
            are lauded with every blessing just as if they were colleagues of
            God.<a id="noteref_431" name="noteref_431" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In conformity
            with these thoughts, the Confessions of the Reformation all agree
            in reprobating prayers to the saints. The Augsburg Confession
            says:</p>

            prayer is to be through Christ alone, and the saints and relics
            are not to be worshipped. And no prayer-book or liturgy in any
            branch of the Reformed Church contains prayers addressed to any
            of the saints or to the Blessed Virgin.</p>

            adoration.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. The

            instructions issued by the Synod which met at Bern in 1532 are
            very emphatic upon this thought, as may be seen from the headings
            of the various articles: (Art. 2) That the whole doctrine is the
            unique Christ (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

            sye</span></span>); (Art. 3) That God is revealed to the people
            in Christ alone; (Art. 5) That the gracious God is perceived
            through Christ alone without any mediation; (Art. 6) A Christian
            sermon is entirely about and from Christ. It is said under the
            third article: <span class="tei tei-q">“His Son in Whom we see
            the work of God and His Fatherly heart toward us ... which is not
            the case where the preacher talks much about God in the heathen

            Christ.”</span><a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434" href=

            Confessions also unite in declaring that the gift of the Holy
            Spirit comes from Christ.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. The
            conception that Christ filled the whole sphere of God, which was
            for the Reformers a fundamental and experimental fact, enabled
            them to construct a spiritual doctrine of the sacraments which
            they opposed to that held in the mediæval Church. Of course, it
            was various theories about the sacraments which caused the chief
            differences among the Reformers themselves; but apart from all
            varying ideas—consubstantiation, ubiquity, signs exhibiting and
            signs representing—the Reformers united on the thoughts that the
            efficacy in the sacraments depended entirely on the promises of
            Christ contained in His word, and that the virtue in the
            sacraments consisted in the presence of Christ to the believing
            communicant. What was received in the sacraments was not a vague,
            mysterious, not to say magical, grace, but Christ Jesus Himself.
            He gave Himself in the sacraments in whatever way His presence
            might be explained.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They all
            taught that the efficacy of the sacraments depends upon the
            promise of Christ contained in their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            and sacrament must always be taken together. Thus Luther points
            out in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Babylonish Captivity of the
            Church</span></span> that one objection to the Roman practice is
            that the recipients <span class="tei tei-q">“never hear the words
            of the promise which are secretly mumbled by the priest,”</span>
            and exhorts his readers never to lose sight of the all-important
            connection between the word of promise and the sacraments; and in
            his Large Catechism he declares that the sacraments include the
            Word. <span class="tei tei-q">“I exhort you,”</span> he says,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“never to sunder the Word and the water,
            or to separate them. For where the Word is withheld we have only
            such water as the maid uses to cook with.”</span> Non-Lutheran
            Confessions are equally decided on the necessity of connecting
            the promise and the words of Christ with the sacraments. The
            Thirty-nine Articles declare that the sacraments are effectual
            because of <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ's institution and
            promise.”</span> The Heidelberg or Palatine Catechism (1563) says
            that the sacraments <span class="tei tei-q">“are holy and visible
            signs ordained of God, to the end that He might thereby the more
            fully declare and seal unto us the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">promise</span></em> of the Holy
            Gospel.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Similarly the
            Reformers unanimously declared that the virtue in the sacraments
            consisted in no mysterious grace, but in the fact that in them
            believing partakers met and received Christ Himself. In the
            articles of the Bern Synod (1532) we are told that the sacraments
            are mysteries of God, <span class="tei tei-q">“through which from
            without Christ is proffered to believers.”</span> The First
            Helvetic Confession (1536) says, concerning the Holy Supper,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“we hold that in the same the Lord truly
            offers His Body and His Blood, that is, Himself, to His
            own.”</span> The Second Helvetic Confession (1562) declares that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Body of Christ is in heaven at the
            right hand of the Father,”</span> and enjoins communicants
            <span class="tei tei-q">“to lift up their hearts and not to
            direct them downwards to the bread. For as the sun, though absent
            from us in the heaven, is none the less efficaciously present ...
            so much more the Sun of righteousness absent from us in the
            heavens in His Body, is present to us not indeed corporeally, but
            spiritually by a life-giving activity.”</span> The French
            Confession of 1557 says that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page480">[pg 480]</span><a name="Pg480" id="Pg480" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> the sacraments are pledges and seals, and
            adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet we hold that their substance
            and truth is in Jesus Christ.”</span> So the Scots Confession of
            1560 declares that <span class="tei tei-q">“we assuredlie beleeve
            that be Baptisme we ar ingrafted in Christ Jesus to be made
            partakers of His justice, be quhilk our sinnes ar covered and
            remitted. And alswa, that in the Supper richtlie used, Christ
            Jesus is so joined with us, that Hee becummis very nurishment and
            fude of our saules.”</span> In the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Manner of the
            Administration of the Lord's Supper</span></span> the Scottish
            Reformation Church directed the minister in his exhortation to
            say to the people: <span class="tei tei-q">“The end of our coming
            to the Lord's Table ... is to seek our life and perfection in
            Jesus Christ, acknowledging ourselves at the same time to be
            children of wrath and condemnation. Let us consider then that
            this sacrament is a singular medicine for all poor sick
            creatures, a comfortable help to weak souls, and that our Lord
            requireth no other worthiness on our part, but that we
            unfeignedly acknowledge our naughtiness and
            imperfection.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Everywhere in
            prayer, worship, and teaching the Reformers see Christ filling
            the whole sphere of God. Jesus was God appearing in history and
            addressing man.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            Epistles of St. Paul, the Church of Christ stands forth as a
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">fellowship</span></em> which is both divine
            and human. On the side of the divine it is a fellowship with
            Jesus, its crucified, risen, and ascended Lord; on the human, it
            is a fellowship among men who stand in the same relation to
            Jesus. This fellowship with Jesus and with the brethren is the
            secret of the Church—what expresses it, what makes it different
            from all other fellowships. Every other characteristic which
            belongs to it must be coloured by this thought of a double
            fellowship. It is the double relation which makes it difficult to
            construct a conception of the Church. It is easy to feel it as an
            experience, but it has always been found hard to express it in
            propositions.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page481">[pg
            481]</span><a name="Pg481" id="Pg481" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It does not
            require much elaborate thinking to construct a theory of the
            Church which will be true to all that is said about the
            fellowship on its divine side; nor is it very difficult to think
            of a great visible and historical organisation which in some
            external aspects represents the Christian fellowship, provided
            the hidden union with Christ, so prominent in St. Paul's
            descriptions, be either entirely neglected or explained in
            external and material ways. The difficulty arises when both the
            divine and the human sides of the fellowship are persistently and
            earnestly kept in view.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is always
            hard to explain the unseen by the seen, the eternal by the
            temporal, and the divine by the human; and the task is almost
            greater than usual when the union of these two elements in the
            Church of Christ is the theme of discussion. It need not surprise
            us, therefore, that all down through the Middle Ages there
            appear, not one, but two conceptions of the Christian Church
            which never harmonised. On the one side, the Church was thought
            of as a fellowship of God with man, depending on the inscrutable
            purpose of God, and independent of all visible outward
            organisation; on the other, it was a great society which existed
            in the world of history, and was held together by visible
            political ties like other societies. Augustine had both
            conceptions, and the dialectical skill of the great theologian of
            the West was unable to fuse them into one harmonious whole.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These two
            separate, almost mutually exclusive, ideas of what the Church of
            Christ was, lived side by side during the Middle Ages in the same
            unconnected fashion. The former, the spiritual Church with its
            real but unseen fellowship with Christ, was the pre-eminently
            religious thought. It was the ground on which the most
            conspicuous mediæval piety rested. It was the garden in which
            bloomed the flowers of mediæval mystical devotion. The latter was
            built up by the juristic dialectic of Roman canonists into the
            conception that the Church was a visible hierarchical State
            having a strictly monarchical constitution—its king being the
            Bishop of Rome, who was the visible representative of Christ.
            This conception became <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page482">[pg
            482]</span><a name="Pg482" id="Pg482" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            almost purely political. It was the active force in all
            ecclesiastical struggles with princes and peoples, with
            Reformers, and with so-called heretics and schismatics. It
            reduced the Church to the level of the State, and contained
            little to stimulate to piety or to holy living.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The labours of
            the great Schoolmen of the thirteenth century did try to
            transform this political Church into what might represent the
            double fellowship with Christ and with fellow-believers which is
            so prominent a thought in the New Testament. They did so by
            attempting to show that the great political Church was an
            enclosure containing certain indefinite mysterious powers of
            redemption which saved men who willingly placed themselves within
            the sphere of their operation. They maintained that the core of
            the hierarchical constitution of the Church was the priesthood,
            and that this priesthood was a species of plastic medium through
            which, and through which alone, God worked in dispensing, by
            means of the sacraments entrusted to the priesthood, His saving
            grace. It may be questioned whether the thought of the Church as
            an institution, possessing within itself certain mysterious
            redemptive powers which are to be found nowhere else, was ever
            thoroughly harmonised with that which regarded it as a mass of
            legal statutes embodied in canon law and dominated by papal
            absolutism. The two conceptions remained distinct, mutually
            aiding each other, but never exactly coalescing. Thus in the
            sixteenth century no less than three separate ideas of the Church
            of Christ were present to fill the minds and imaginations of men;
            but the dominant idea for the practical religious life was
            certainly that which represented the Church as an institution
            which, because it possessed the priesthood, was the society
            within which salvation was to be found.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther had
            enjoyed to the full the benefits of this society, and had with
            ardour and earnestness sought to make use of all its redemptive
            powers. He had felt, simply because he was so honest with
            himself, that it had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page483">[pg
            483]</span><a name="Pg483" id="Pg483" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            not made him a real Christian, and that its mysterious powers had
            worked on him in vain. His living Christian experience made him
            know and feel that whatever the Church of Christ was, it was not
            a society within which priests exercised their secret science of
            redemption. It was and must be a fellowship of holy and
            Christlike people; but he felt it very difficult to express his
            experience in phrases that could satisfy him. It was hard to get
            rid of thoughts which he had cherished from childhood, and none
            of these inherited beliefs had more power over him than the idea
            that the Church, however described, was the Pope's House in which
            the Bishop of Rome ruled, and ought to rule, as house-father. It
            is interesting to study by what devious paths he arrived at a
            clear view of what the Church of Christ really is;<a id=

            notice how shreds of the old opinions which had lain dormant in
            his mind every now and then start afresh into life; and how,
            while he had learnt to know the uselessness of many institutions
            of the mediæval Church, he could not easily divest his mind of
            the thought that they naturally belonged to a Church Visible.
            Monastic vows, the celibacy of the clergy, fasting, the
            hierarchy, the supremacy of the Pope, the power of
            excommunication with all its dreaded consequences, were all the
            natural accompaniments of a Visible Church according to mediæval
            ideas, and Luther relinquished them with difficulty. From the
            first, Augustine's thought of the Church, which consists of the
            elect, helped him; he found that Huss held the same idea, and he
            wrote to a friend that <span class="tei tei-q">“we have been all
            Hussites without knowing it.”</span><a id="noteref_436" name=

            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a> But
            while Luther and all the Reformers held strongly by this
            conception of Augustine, it was not of very much service in
            determining the conception of the Visible Church which was the
            more important practically; and although the definition of the
            Catholic Church Invisible has found its way into most
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page484">[pg 484]</span><a name=
            "Pg484" id="Pg484" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Protestant
            Confessions, and has been used by Protestants polemically, it has
            always remained something of a background, making clearer the
            conception of the Church in general, but has been of little
            service in giving clear views of what the Church Visible is. From
            the very first, however, Luther saw in a certain indefinite way
            that there was a real connection between the conception of the
            Visible Church and the proclamation of the Word of God—a thought
            which was destined to grow more and more definite till it
            completely possessed him. As early as October 1518, he could
            inform Cajetan that the Pope must be under the rule of the Word
            of God and not superior to it.<a id="noteref_437" name=

            discovery that the communion of the saints (<span lang="la"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=

            made soon afterwards. After the Leipzig Disputation his views
            became clearer, and by 1520 they stood revealed in the three
            great Reformation treatises.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther's
            doctrine of the Church is extremely simple. The Church is, as the
            Creed defines it to be, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Communion of the Saints</span></span>, which
            has come into existence through the proclamation of the Word of
            God heard and received by faith. He simplified this fundamental
            Christian conception in a wonderful way. The Church rests on the
            sure and stable foundation of the Word of God; and this Word of
            God is not a weary round of statutes issued blasphemously by the
            Bishops of Rome in God's name. It is not the invitations of a
            priesthood to come and share mysterious and indefinite powers of
            salvation given to them in their command over the sacraments. It
            is not a lengthy doctrinal system constructed out of detached
            texts of Holy Scripture by the application of a fourfold sense
            used under the guidance of a dogmatic tradition or a rule of
            faith. It is the substance of the Scriptures. It is the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“gospel according to a pure
            understanding.”</span> It is the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“promises of God”</span>; <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the testimony of Jesus, Who is the Saviour of
            souls”</span>; it is the <span class="tei tei-q">“consolations
            offered in Christ.”</span> It is, as Calvin said, <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page485">[pg 485]</span><a name="Pg485" id=
            "Pg485" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            spiritual gate whereby we enter into God's heavenly
            kingdom”</span>; the <span class="tei tei-q">“mirror in which
            faith beholds God.”</span> It is, according to the Westminster
            Confession, the sum of God's commands, threatenings, promises,
            and, above all, the offer of Christ Jesus. All these things are
            apprehended by faith. The Church comes into existence by faith
            responding to the proclamation of the Word of God. This is the
            sure and stable thing upon which the Church of Christ is
            founded.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Church of
            Christ, therefore, is a body of which the Spirit of Jesus is the
            soul. It is a company of Christlike men and women, whom the Holy
            Spirit has called, enlightened, and sanctified through the
            preaching of the word; who are encouraged to look forward to a
            glorious future prepared for the people of God; and who,
            meanwhile, manifest their faith in all manner of loving services
            done to their fellow-believers.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Church is
            therefore in some sense invisible. Its secret is its hidden
            fellowship with Jesus. Its roots penetrate the unseen, and draw
            from thence the nourishment needed to sustain its life. But it is
            a visible society, and can be seen wherever the Word of God is
            faithfully proclaimed, and wherever faith is manifested in
            testimony and in bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the
            essential mode of describing the Church which has found place in
            the Reformation creeds. Some vary in the ways in which they
            express the thought; some do not sufficiently distinguish, in
            words at least, between what the Church is and what it has,
            between what makes its being and what is included in its
            well-being. But in all there are the two thoughts that the Church
            is made visible by the two fundamental things—the proclamation of
            the word and the manifestation of faith.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This mode of
            describing the Church of Christ defines it by that element which
            separates it from all other forms of human association—its
            special relation to the divine; and it is shown to be visible at
            the place where that divine element can and does manifest itself.
            It defines the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page486">[pg
            486]</span><a name="Pg486" id="Pg486" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            Church by its most essential element, and sets aside all that is
            accidental. It concerns itself with what the Church is, and does
            not include what the Church has. It therefore provides room for
            all things which belong to the well-being of the Church—only it
            relegates them to their proper place.<a id="noteref_439" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the
            proclamation of the Word of God, and the manifestation of the
            faith which answers, be the essence of the Church, all that tends
            to aid both is to be included in the thought. There must be a
            ministry of some sort in word and sacrament instituted within the
            Church of Christ in order to lead the individual to faith. God
            has created this ministry, and all the Reformed Churches were
            careful to declare that no one should seek entrance into office
            unless he was assured that he had been called of God thereto; and
            as his function is to be a minister of the Church and a servant
            of the faithful, no one <span class="tei tei-q">“should publicly
            teach or administer the sacraments unless he be duly called
            (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">nisi rite
            vocatus</span></span>).”</span> Such a ministry has its field
            simply in ministering the means of grace. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The Church of Christ,”</span> says Luther,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“requires an honest ministry diligently
            and loyally instructed in the holy Word of God after a pure
            Christian understanding, and without the addition of any false
            traditions. In and through such a ministry it will be made plain
            what are Christ and His Evangel, how to attain to the forgiveness
            of sins, and the properties and power of the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">keys</span></em>
            in the Church.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this is
            matter of administration. Some societies of believers may have
            different ideas about the precise form that this ministry ought
            to take; but such differences, while they may lead to separate
            administrations, do not imply any separation from the one
            Catholic Church of Christ to which they all belong. However
            outwardly they differ, all retain the essential things—the
            preaching and teaching of the Word of God and the due
            administration of the sacraments. Some may prefer to set forth a
            creed of one kind and others may prefer another. The French,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page487">[pg 487]</span><a name=
            "Pg487" id="Pg487" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Scottish, and
            the Dutch Churches had all their own creeds, and all believed
            each other to be parts of the same One Catholic Church of
            Christ.</p>

            experience and providence which the Scriptures contain. God's

          does cavalry armed with lances, is very misleading. The victories
          of the Swiss peasants, and their reputation as soldiers, suggested
          to the Emperor Frederick, and especially to his son, the Emperor
          Maximilian, the formation of troops of infantry recruited from the
          peasantry and from the lower classes of townsmen. Troops of cavalry
          of a like origin were also formed, and they were called <span lang=

          frequently gained much money both from pay and from plunder, and
          were regarded as heroes by the members of the classes from whom
          they had sprung. Liliencron's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">There is one persistent contemporary
          suggestion, that Luther was finally driven to take the step by the
          sudden death of a companion, for which a good deal may be said.
          Oergel has shown, from minute researches in the university
          archives, that a special friend of Luther's, Hieronymus Pontz of
          Windsheim, who was working along with him for his Magister's
          degree, died suddenly of pleurisy before the end of the
          examination; that a few weeks after Luther had taken his degree,
          another promising student whom he knew died of the plague; that the
          plague broke out again in Erfurt three months afterwards; and that
          Luther entered the convent a few days after this second appearance
          of the plague.—Cf. Georg Oergel, <span class=

          Luther was certainly taught the theology of John of Paltz, and the

          the disposition which possessed them, history has designated as
          eminent Christians, we have always the same type; we find marked

          This frame of mind is taught in sermons and in instruction by truly

          trained, and dogmatics are constructed in harmony with it. It has

          struggle of the awakened soul, lay most stress on that part of the
          conflict which comes from temptations of the flesh; Gerson confines
          himself to those which are purely spiritual. Luther, during his
          soul-anguish in the convent, was a young monk who had lived a

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">It is commonly said that Luther made

          "font-style: italic">mystical</span></em> passages found in these
          and other authors; but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mystical</span></em> is a very ambiguous word.
          It is continually used to express personal or individual piety in
          general; or this personal religion as opposed to that religious
          life which is consciously lived within the fellowship of men called
          the Church, provided with the external means of grace. These are,
          however, very loose uses of the word. The fundamental problem, even
          in Christian Mysticism, appears to me to be how to bridge the gulf
          between the creature and the Creator, while the problem in
          Reformation theology is how to span the chasm between the sinful
          man and the righteous God. Hence in mysticism the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tendency</span></em> is always to regard sin
          as imperfection, while in the Reformation theology sin is always
          the power of evil and invariably includes the thought of guilt.
          Luther was no mystic in the sense of desiring to be lost <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em> God:
          he wished to be saved <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Of course, Luther's intense
          individuality appeared in his language from the first. Take as an
          example a note on Ps. lxxxiv. 4: <span class="tei tei-q">“As the
          meadow is to the cow, the house to the man, the nest to the bird,

          Theology, and Amsdorf had made a great name for himself as an

          in the confidential letters to his brother in the last troubled

          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">v.</span></span> had for his confessor
          Jean Glapion, who figured largely in the preliminary scenes before
          Luther arrived at Worms. He had a remarkable conversation with Dr.
          Brück, the Elector of Saxony's Chancellor, in which he professed to
          speak for the Emperor as well as for himself. Luther's earlier
          writings had given him great pleasure; he believed him to be a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“plant of renown,”</span> able to produce
          splendid fruit for the Church. But the book on the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Babylonian
          Captivity</span></span> had shocked him; he did not believe it to
          be Luther's; it was not in his usual style; if Luther had written
          it, it must have been because he was momentarily indignant at the
          papal Bull, and as it was anonymous, it could easily be repudiated;
          or if not repudiated, it might be explained, and its sentences
          shown to be capable of a Catholic interpretation. If this were
          done, and if Luther withdrew his violent writings against the Pope,
          there was no reason why an amicable arrangement should not be come
          to. The Papal Bull could easily be got over, it could be withdrawn
          on the ground that Luther had never had a fair trial. It was a
          mistake to suppose that the Emperor was not keenly alive to the
          need for a reformation of the Church; there were limits to his
          devotion to the Pope; the Emperor believed that he would deserve
          the wrath of God if he did not try to amend the deplorable
          condition of the Church of Christ. Such was Glapion's statement. It
          is a question how far he was sincere, and how far he could speak
          for the Emperor. He was a friend and admirer of Erasmus; but the
          Dutchman had said that no man could conceal his own views so
          skilfully. The Elector heard that after this conversation Glapion
          had got from Aleander 400 copies of the Bull against Luther, and
          had distributed them among Franciscan monks. This made him doubt
          his sincerity, and he refused to grant him an audience. Cf.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">A study of dates throws light on these
          bargainings. In Oct. 1520, Charles issued an edict ordering the
          burning of Luther's books within his hereditary dominions. In the
          following weeks Aleander was pressing Charles to make the edict
          universal; this was declared to be impossible, but (Nov. 28th)
          Charles wrote to the Elector of Saxony ordering him to produce
          Luther at Worms, and to hinder him from writing anything more
          against the Pope; as it were in answer (Dec. 12th), the Pope
          intimated to Charles that he had withdrawn his briefs about the
          Inquisition in Spain. The Emperor reached Worms about the middle of
          December. On Jan. 3rd (1521) the Pope simplified matters for the
          Emperor by issuing a new Bull, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Decet
          Romanum</span></span>, containing the names of Luther and Hutten;
          the Diet opened Jan. 28th; Aleander made his three hours' speech
          against Luther on Feb. 13; Feb. 19th, the Estates resolved that
          Luther should appear before them, and not for the simple purpose of
          recantation—he was to be heard, and to receive a safe conduct;
          March 6th, the imperial invitation and safe conduct, beginning with
          the words, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">nobilis, derote, nobis
          dilecte</span></span>; Aleander protested vehemently against this
          address; the Emperor drafted a universal mandate ordering the
          burning of Luther's books; this probably was not published; it was
          withdrawn in favour of a mandate ordering all Luther's books to be
          delivered up to the magistrates; this was published in Worms on
          March 27th, and caused rioting; April 17th and 18th, Luther
          appeared before the Diet; May 8th, Charles received the Pope's
          pledge to take his side against Francis; Diet agreed to the ban
          against Luther on May 25th; Charles dated the ban May 8th.</dd>

          Aleander, writing to Rome, says that the Official went on to say in
          the name of the Emperor that Luther ought to bear it in mind that
          he had written many things against the Pope and the Apostolic
          Chair, and had scattered recklessly many heretical statements which
          had caused great scandal, and which, if not speedily ended, would
          kindle such a great conflagration as neither Luther's recantation
          nor the imperial power could extinguish; and that he exhorted
          Luther to be mindful of this (Brieger, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Aleander</span></span>, p. 147). In Eck's

          but they must have been included in his speech, for Peutinger

          description of the scene coming from contemporary sources shows

          an exact recollection of the last words of Luther. If it were not
          for Dr. Peutinger's very definite statement written almost
          immediately after the event, there seems to be no reason why the

          of concessions which would content the Lutherans. Melanchthon seems

          the Eucharist in both kinds; marriage of priests permitted; the
          omission of the canon of the Mass; concession of the Church lands
          already sequestrated; and the decision of the other matters in

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Luther's action is usually attributed
          to his desire not to offend a powerful Protestant leader. A careful
          study of the original documents in the case—correspondence and
          papers—does not confirm this view. To my mind, they show on
          Luther's part a somewhat sullen and crabbed conscientious fidelity
          to a conviction which he always maintained. With all his reverence
          for the word of God, he could never avoid giving a very large
          authority to the traditions of the Church when they did not plainly
          contradict a positive and direct divine commandment. The Church had
          been accustomed to say that it possessed a dispensing power in
          matrimonial cases of extreme difficulty; and, in spite of his
          denunciations of the dispensations granted by the Roman Curia,
          Luther never denied the power. On the contrary, he thought honestly
          that the Church did possess this power of dispensation even to the
          length of tampering with a fundamental law of Christian society,
          provided it did not contradict a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">positive</span></em> scriptural commandment to
          the contrary. The crime of the Curia, in his eyes, was not issuing
          dispensations in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">necessary cases</span></em>, but in giving
          them in cases without proved necessity, <em class=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">The Religious Peace of Augsburg had
          important diplomatic consequences beyond Germany. The Lutheran form
          of faith was recognised to be a <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">religio licita</span></span> (to use the old
          Roman phrase) within the Holy Roman Empire, which, according to the
          legal ideas of the day, included all Western Christendom; and Popes
          could no longer excommunicate Protestants simply because they were
          Protestants, without striking a serious blow at the constitution of
          the Empire. No one perceived this sooner than the sagacious young
          woman who became the first Protestant Queen of England. In the
          earlier and unsettled years of her reign, Elizabeth made full use
          of the protection that a profession of the Lutheran Creed gave to
          shield her from excommunication. She did so when the Count de
          Feria, the ambassador of Philip <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span>, threatened her with
          the fate of the King of Navarre (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Calendar of Letters
          and State Papers relating to English Affairs, preserved principally
          in the Archives of Simancas</span></span>, i. 61, 62); she
          suppressed all opinions which might be supposed to conflict with
          the Lutheran Creed in the Thirty-eight Articles of 1563; she kept
          crosses and lights on the altar of her chapel in Lutheran fashion.
          When the Pope first drafted a Bull to excommunicate the English
          Queen, and submitted it to the Emperor, he was told that it would
          be an act of folly to publish a document which would invalidate the
          Emperor's own election; and when Elizabeth was finally
          excommunicated in 1570, the charge against her was not being a
          Protestant, but sharing in <span class="tei tei-q">“the impious
          mysteries of Calvin”</span>—the Reformed or Calvinist Churches
          being outside the Peace of Augsburg.</dd>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It maybe
            useful to note the statements about the authority of Scripture in
            the earlier Reformation creeds. The Lutherans, always late in
            discerning the true doctrinal bearings of their religious
            certainties, did not deem it needful to assert dogmatically the
            supreme authority of Scripture until the second generation of
            Protestantism. The Schmalkald Articles and the Augsburg
            Confession expressly assert that human traditions are among
            abuses that ought to be done away with; but they do not condemn
            them as authorities set up by their opponents in opposition to
            the word of God, only as things that burden the conscience and
            incline men to false ways of trying to be at peace with God
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Torgau Book, and in 1580 in the <span class=

            Concordiæ</span></span>, that they felt the necessity of

            that <span class="tei tei-q">“the only standard by which all
            dogmas and all teachers must be valued and judged is no other
            than the prophetic and apostolic writings of the Old and of the

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Zwingli, with
            the clearer dogmatic insight which he always showed, felt the
            need of a statement about the theological place of Scripture very
            early, and declared in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            (1536) that <span class="tei tei-q">“Canonic Scripture, the word

            rule of life.”</span> The various Reformed Confessions, inspired
            by Calvin, followed Zwingli's example, and the supreme authority
            of Scripture was set forth in all the symbolical books of the
            Reformed Churches of Switzerland, France, England, the
            Netherlands, Scotland, etc.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            where it is declared that all who say that the Evangel is of no
            value apart from its confirmation by the Church err and blaspheme
            against God, and where the sum of the Evangel is <span class=

            God.”</span> The main thought, therefore, in all these
            Confessions is not to assert the formal supremacy of Scripture
            over Tradition, but rather to declare the supreme value of
            Scripture which reveals God's good will to us in Jesus Christ to
            be received by faith alone over all human traditions which would
            lead us astray from God and from true faith. The Reformers had
            before them not simply the theological desire to define precisely
            the nature of that authority to which all Christian teaching
            appeals, but the religious need to cling to the divinely revealed
            way of salvation and to turn away from all human interposition
            and corruption. They desire to make known that they trust God
            rather than man. Hence almost all of them are careful to express
            clearly the need for the Witness of the Holy Spirit.</p>

              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways

              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>
